        "statement": "Washington.--In the view of America's spy services, the      next potential threat from Russia may not come from a      nefarious cyberweapon or secrets gleaned from the files of      Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency      contractor now in Moscow.       Instead, this menace may come in the form of a seemingly      innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-     packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in      the United States.       In recent months, the Central Intelligence Agency and the      Pentagon have been quietly waging a campaign to stop the      State Department from allowing Roscosmos, the Russian space      agency, to build about half a dozen of these structures,      known as monitor stations, on United States soil, several      American officials said.       They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on      the United States and improve the precision of Russian      weaponry, the officials said. These monitor stations, the      Russians contend, would significantly improve the accuracy      and reliability of Moscow's version of the Global Positioning      System, the American satellite network that steers guided      missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the      nearest Starbucks.       ``They don't want to be reliant on the American system and      believe that their systems, like GPS, will spawn other      industries and applications,'' said a former senior official      in the State Department's Office of Space and Advanced      Technology. ``They feel as though they are losing a      technological edge to us in an important market. Look at      everything GPS has done on things like your phone and the      movement of planes and ships.''       The Russian effort is part of a larger global race by      several countries--including China and European Union      nations--to perfect their own global positioning systems and      challenge the dominance of the American GPS.       For the State Department, permitting Russia to build the      stations would help mend the Obama administration's      relationship with the government of President Vladimir V.      Putin, now at a nadir because of Moscow's granting asylum to      Mr. Snowden and its backing of President Bashar al-Assad of      Syria.       But the C.I.A. and other American spy agencies, as well as      the Pentagon, suspect that the monitor stations would give      the Russians a foothold on American territory that would      sharpen the accuracy of Moscow's satellite-steered weapons.      The stations, they believe, could also give the Russians an      opening to snoop on the United States within its borders.       The squabble is serious enough that administration      officials have delayed a final decision until the Russians      provide more information and until the American agencies sort      out their differences, State Department and White House      officials said.        Russia's efforts have also stirred concerns on Capitol      Hill, where members of the intelligence and armed services      committees view Moscow's global positioning network--known as      Glonass, for Global Navigation Satellite System--with deep      suspicion and are demanding answers from the administration.       ``I would like to understand why the United States would be      interested in enabling a GPS competitor, like Russian      Glonass, when the world's reliance on GPS is a clear      advantage to the United States on multiple levels,'' said      Representative Mike D. Rogers, Republican of Alabama, the      chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee.       Mr. Rogers last week asked the Pentagon to provide an      assessment of the proposal's impact on national security. The      request was made in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck      Hagel, Secretary of State John Kerry and the director of      national intelligence, James R. Clapper, Jr.       The monitor stations have been a high priority of Mr. Putin      for several years as a means to improve Glonass not only to      benefit the Russian military and civilian sectors but also to      compete globally with GPS.       Earlier this year, Russia positioned a station in Brazil,      and agreements with Spain, Indonesia and Australia are      expected soon, according to Russian news reports. The United      States has stations around the world, but none in Russia.       Russian and American negotiators last met on April 25 to      weigh ``general requirements for possible Glonass monitoring      stations in U.S. territory and the scope of planned future      discussions,'' said a State Department spokeswoman, Marie      Harf, who said no final decision had been made.       Ms. Harf and other administration officials declined to      provide additional information. The C.I.A. declined to      comment.       The Russian government offered few details about the      program. In a statement, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy      in Washington, Yevgeniy Khorishko, said that the stations      were deployed ``only to ensure calibration and precision of      signals for the Glonass system.'' Mr. Khorishko referred all      questions to Roscosmos, which did not respond to a request      for comment last week.       Although the Cold War is long over, the Russians do not      want to rely on the American GPS infrastructure because they      remain suspicious of the United States' military      capabilities, security analysts say. That is why they have      insisted on pressing ahead with their own system despite the      high costs.       Accepting the dominance of GPS, Russians fear, would give      the United States some serious strategic advantages      militarily. In Russians' worst fears, analysts said,      Americans could potentially manipulate signals and send      erroneous information to Russian armed forces.       Monitor stations are essential to maintaining the accuracy      of a global positioning system, according to Bradford W.      Parkinson, a professor emeritus of aeronautics and      astronautics at Stanford University, who was the original      chief architect of GPS. As a satellite's orbit slowly      diverges from its earlier prediction, these small deviations      are measured by the reference stations on the ground and sent      to a central control station for updating, he said. That      prediction is sent to the satellite every 12 hours for      subsequent broadcast to users. Having monitor stations all      around the earth yields improved accuracy over having them      only in one hemisphere.       Washington and Moscow have been discussing for nearly a      decade how and when to cooperate on civilian satellite-based      navigation signals, particularly to ensure that the systems      do not interfere with each other. Indeed, many smartphones      and other consumer navigation systems sold in the United      States today use data from both countries' satellites.       In May 2012, Moscow requested that the United States allow      the ground-monitoring stations on American soil. American      technical and diplomatic officials have met several times to      discuss the issue and have asked Russian officials for more      information, said Ms. Harf, the State Department spokeswoman.       In the meantime, C.I.A. analysts reviewed the proposal and      concluded in a classified report this fall that allowing the      Russian monitor stations here would raise counterintelligence      and other security issues.       The State Department does not think that is a strong      argument, said an administration official. ``It doesn't see      them as a threat.''",

        "statement": "Vice President Cheney convened a meeting in the Situation      Room at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, March 10, 2004, with just one      day left before the warrantless domestic surveillance program      was set to expire. Around him were National Security Agency      Director Michael V. Hayden, White House counsel Alberto R.      Gonzales and the Gang of Eight--the four ranking members of      the House and the Senate, and the chairmen and vice chairmen      of the intelligence committees.       Even now, three months into a legal rebellion at the      Justice Department, President Bush was nowhere in the      picture. He was stumping in the battleground state of Ohio,      talking up the economy.       With a nod from Cheney, Hayden walked through the program's      vital mission. Gonzales said top lawyers at the NSA and      Justice had green-lighted the program from the beginning. Now      Attorney General John D. Ashcroft was in the hospital, and      James B. Comey, Ashcroft's deputy, refused to certify that      the surveillance was legal.       That was misleading at best. Cheney and Gonzales knew that      Comey spoke for Ashcroft as well. They also knew, but chose      not to mention, that Jack L. Goldsmith, chief of the Office      of Legal Counsel at Justice, had been warning of major legal      problems for months.       More than three years later, Gonzales would testify that      there was ``consensus in the room'' from the lawmakers, ``who      said, `Despite the recommendation of the deputy attorney      general, go forward with these very important intelligence      activities.' '' By this account--disputed by participants      from both parties--four Democrats and four Republicans      counseled Cheney to press on with a program that Justice      called illegal.       In fact, Cheney asked the lawmakers a question that came      close to answering itself. Could the House and Senate amend      surveillance laws without raising suspicions that a new      program had been launched? The obvious reply became a new      rationale for keeping Congress out.       The Bush administration had no interest in changing the      law, according to U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth,      chief of the federal government's special surveillance court      when the warrantless eavesdropping began.       ``We could have gone to Congress, hat in hand, the judicial      branch and the executive together, and gotten any statutory      change we wanted in those days, I felt like,'' he said in an      interview. ``But they wanted to demonstrate that the      president's power was supreme.''",

Consular employees, State Department consular employees have granted visas to bad people. They have made mistakes. Therefore, eliminate them. Eliminate the State Department role. Under that logic, the CIA should be taken out of intelligence-gathering because they did not know that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons during the 1980s. The central office of the FBI should be collapsed because they did not act on messages from the Phoenix and Minneapolis offices regarding suspicious activities by people in the United States. And the National Security Agency should be folded up because it did not translate intercepted communications fast enough to warn us about September 11.",

Unfortunately, NSA's serious acquisition management problems persist, preventing the agency from keeping pace with the global telecommunications industry. These problems contributed to limiting NSA's operational capabilities in key areas relevant to the war on terrorism and other so-called transnational threats as noted in the report of the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security on the events of September 11. NSA's problems could have very serious consequences and, in my opinion, demand more attention from the Secretary of Defense.",

        "statement": "Anyone who has read or watched any news source over the      past year knows President Obama, numerous Administration      officials, and many leaders in Congress agree that addressing      the threat of cyber attacks is a critical national priority.      Based on this threat analysis, the administration and many      members of Congress continue to push for passage of      cybersecurity legislation that would clarify and expand the      government's powers to receive and process traffic from      American computer networks.       It would, however, be a mistake for Congress to rush to      enact legislation that could militarize our computer      networks, and pave the way for private companies to share      vast quantities of sensitive and highly personal information      with the government, all in the name of ``cybersecurity.''      Although a carefully-crafted ``information sharing'' program      that includes robust protections for civil liberties could be      an effective approach to cybersecurity, the bill about to      come up for a vote in the House clearly fails this test.       The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA),      H.R. 624, is set to be considered by the full House of      Representatives later this month. Although the bill that      emerged from markup by the House Permanent Select Committee      on Intelligence (HPSCI) includes some improvements in privacy      safeguards over the earlier version, CISPA's proponents have      overstated the protections incorporated into the bill. As a      result, members of Congress should vote against CISPA when it      comes to the House floor.       Last year, The Constitution Project's bipartisan Liberty      and Security Committee, on which I serve, prepared a detailed      report on ways that Congress could protect our nation's      computer networks from cyber threats, while at the same time      preserving the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of      Americans. Unfortunately, the drafters of CISPA failed to      incorporate the robust safeguards we recommended.       Most critical, CISPA's sponsors have resisted all efforts      to ensure that the new cybersecurity program would maintain      civilian control of our nation's computer networks. CISPA      would allow private companies, cloaked with broad immunity      from legal liability, to share sensitive information such as      internet records or the content of emails, with any agency in      the government, including military and intelligence agencies.      Sensitive personal information from private computer networks      should not be shared directly with the military or the      National Security Agency (NSA), the agency that gained      widespread public notoriety seven years ago for its      warrantless wiretapping program--hardly the agency we want to      see tasked with receiving private internet traffic.       Sadly, the members of HPSCI voted down an amendment that      would have ensured civilian control of computer networks, by      specifying that when private companies share information with      the federal government, they should not provide it to the NSA      or any other military agency or department. This amendment      would still have permitted the NSA to share its own expertise      on cyber threats with the private sector, but would have      protected the information flowing into the government.       A second critical flaw with CISPA is that it fails to      include meaningful limits on the extent of private sensitive      information that companies can send into the government. The      HPSCI also voted down an amendment requiring that before      sharing cyber threat information with the government,      companies must ``make reasonable efforts'' to remove ``any      information that can be used to identify a specific person      unrelated to the cyber threat.'' A similar provision was      included in last year's Senate cybersecurity bill, and      witnesses at a hearing before HPSCI earlier this year      testified that companies can easily strip out personally      identifiably information that is not necessary to address      cyber threats. Yet CISPA still lacks any such safeguard.       It is true that from a privacy perspective, this version of      CISPA is an improvement over last year's bill. Most notably,      the bill no longer permits private information to be used for      broad `national security uses'' unrelated to cybersecurity.      But it clearly is not sufficient. Congress must take the      civil liberties threats created by this bill just as      seriously as it takes the cyber threats the legislation      purports to address. CISPA does not meet this test, and      members of the House should just say no.",

        "statement": "Washington.--A Congress derided as do-nothing has a week to      do something, and the prospects are cloudy.       Procrastination, power struggles and partisanship have left      Congress with substantial work to finish before taking a      break at the end of the week for the midterm elections. The      fast-approaching recess and the Republican focus on national      security legislation make it inevitable that much of the      remainder will fall by the wayside.       At best, it appears that only two of the 11 required      spending bills will pass, and not one has been approved so      far, forcing a stopgap measure to keep the federal government      open. No budget was enacted. A popular package of business      and education tax credits is teetering. A lobbying overhaul,      once a top priority in view of corruption scandals, is dead.      The drive for broad immigration changes has derailed.       An offshore oil drilling bill, painted as an answer to high      gas prices, is stalled. Plans to cut the estate tax and raise      the minimum wage have foundered, and an important nuclear      pact with India sought by the White House is not on track to      clear Congress. New problems surfaced over the weekend for      the annual military authorization bill.       And numerous other initiatives await a planned lame-duck      session in mid-November or a future Congress.       ``It is disappointing where we are, and I think Republicans      need to be upfront about this,'' said Representative Jack      Kingston, Republican of Georgia and a member of the House      leadership. ``We have not accomplished what we need to      accomplish.''       Given the practical and political realities, Republicans      have chosen to concentrate on legislation emphasizing their      security credentials, like the bill governing interrogations      and trials of terrorism detainees, a National Security Agency      surveillance program and spending on the Pentagon and the      Department of Homeland Security.       ``With obstruction from the Democrats at an all-time high,      we have focused on four security issues in an effort to enact      some solid, substantive accomplishments,'' said Eric Ueland,      chief of staff to Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the      majority leader, who is stepping down at the end of this      session.       While Republicans prefer to blame Democrats for the      backlog, intramural fights and sharp differences between      House and Senate Republicans have been chief impediments to      major legislation. The fissures over terrorism detainees and      how far to go in changing immigration law are merely the      latest and most public examples of serious policy differences      among Republicans.       Circumstances have changed in Washington from the days when      Republicans were famous for party discipline. President      George W. Bush, weakened by his sliding popularity, has been      unable to hold sway over Congress.       The Republican leadership in the House and the Senate is in      transition and lacks the muscle of the former House majority      leader, Tom DeLay. Republican lawmakers, many facing their      most serious electoral opposition in years, are fending for      themselves.       ``We have no central core of political authority driving      things in Washington,'' said James Thurber, director of the      Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American      University. ``Individuals and expressions of individual will      by committees, and also by strong people like John McCain,      have dominated, and the result is internal fighting.''       Democrats have made no secret of their intention to try to      brand this Congress as worse than lackluster.       ``When we say this is the most do-nothing Congress in the      history of our country, this isn't just flippant,'' said      Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. ``This      is true.'' Besides denouncing the legislative output,      Democrats are mounting an effort to chastise Republicans as      failing to conduct sufficient oversight of the Iraq war.       Republican leaders dispute the notion that this has been an      unproductive session, pointing to legislation on bankruptcy,      class action, highway spending, energy policy and pensions,      as well as to two Supreme Court confirmations. And they say      they already plan to be back Nov. 13 to finish whatever      remains at the end of the week.       Democrats have been happy throughout the year to stand      almost united in both the House and the Senate against many      of the Republican initiatives, forcing the majority to find      enough votes to pass legislation from its own membership.      That has often forced major concessions from the leadership.      In other cases, Republicans in the House and the Senate have      simply been unable to find common ground.       ``In the 26 years I have been here,'' said Representative      Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, ``I don't think I      have ever seen so much tension between the House and the      Senate, and it is all among Republicans.''       The immigration measure was a notable example as House      Republicans refused to entertain the bipartisan Senate bill      that took a comprehensive approach to the flood of illegal      immigrants. A push for a formal budget plan collapsed because      of differences over spending between House and Senate      Republicans.       A House-Senate Republican feud over the handling of a      pension measure, which ultimately passed, left a collection      of tax breaks in limbo despite nearly unanimous support in      Congress. Those tax benefits included a deduction for college      tuition costs and a research and development tax credit for      businesses. The leadership has been reluctant to bring the      benefits to a vote independently because they could be used      to help advance more contentious legislation, like the cut in      the estate tax sought by Republicans.       A new struggle between rank-and-file Republicans and the      leadership threatens to engulf the must-pass spending measure      for domestic security. Lawmakers were insisting that a      provision allowing Americans to bring back cheaper      prescription drugs from Canada be added to the bill even      though House leaders and the pharmaceutical industry oppose      the Plan.",

        "statement": "Congress finds the following:       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,      President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to      intercept communications between people inside the United      States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects      overseas.       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is      that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our      Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy      conventional law enforcement practices.       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most      directly responsible for protecting the United States from      attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an      enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting      the United States against our enemies, the President does not      compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to      safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's      power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an      Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown      Sheet  Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion      by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day      O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme      Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear      that a state of war is not a blank check for the President      when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi      v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our      Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3      branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This      helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not      infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at      the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers      and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and      protect our Nation from attack.       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her      plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,      ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for      the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with      enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly      envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties      are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004)      (citations omitted).       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his      Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to      an express or implied authorization of Congress, his      authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he      possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can      delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either a      congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely      upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of      twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent      authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.      Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence      may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not      invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility .      . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the      expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its      lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own      constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of      Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive      Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the      Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet       Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J.,      concurring).       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation      with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The      Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight      over national security and foreign policy, under article I,      section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which      confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,      and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of      the land and naval Forces'';       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute      the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel      Invasions''; and       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining      the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be      employed in the Service of the United States''.       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that      the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance      program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to      ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief      of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic      surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the      executive branch, by the article III court established under      section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence      committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is      appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the      constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that      may be directed at Americans.       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the      proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic      surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the      secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the      requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive      issues of national security.       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong      defender of executive authority, testified that in times of      conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range      electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence      surveillance court should be empowered to issue special      approval orders in these circumstances.       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and      pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-     established, longstanding practices.       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already      has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of      international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants      for surveillance of a particular individual under sections      104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in      investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held      that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the      Constitution of the United States when they relate to      complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises      like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts      recognize that applications for search warrants must be      judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the      courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature      and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal      organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United      States v. United States District Court for the Eastern      District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that      the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may      not be applicable to cases involving national security. The      Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may      involve different policy and practical considerations from      the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should      be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security      cases. United States v. United States District Court for the      Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress      enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our      national security, while also protecting the civil liberties      and constitutional rights that we cherish.",

(2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is      that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our      Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy      conventional law enforcement practices.       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most      directly responsible for protecting the United States from      attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an      enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting      the United States against our enemies, the President does not      compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to      safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's      power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an      Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown      Sheet  Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion      by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day      O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme      Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear      that a state of war is not a blank check for the President      when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi      v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our      Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3      branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This      helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not      infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at      the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers      and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and      protect our Nation from attack.       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her      plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,      ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for      the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with      enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly      envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties      are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004)      (citations omitted).       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his      Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to      an express or implied authorization of Congress, his      authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he      possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can      delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either      a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only      rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of      twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent      authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.      Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence      may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not      invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility .      . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the      expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its      lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own      constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of      Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive      Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the      Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet       Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J.,      concurring).       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation      with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The      Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight      over national security and foreign policy, under article I,      section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which      confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,      and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of      the land and naval Forces'';       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute      the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel      Invasions''; and       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining      the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be      employed in the Service of the United States''.       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that      the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance      program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to      ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief      of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic      surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the      executive branch, by the article III court established under      section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence      committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is      appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the      constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that      may be directed at Americans.       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the      proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic      surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the      secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the      requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive      issues of national security.       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong      defender of executive authority, testified that in times of      conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range      electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence      surveillance court should be empowered to issue special      approval orders in these circumstances.       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and      pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-     established, longstanding practices.       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already      has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of      international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants      for surveillance of a particular individual under sections      104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in      investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held      that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the      Constitution of the United States when they relate to      complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises      like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts      recognize that applications for search warrants must be      judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the      courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature      and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal      organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United      States v. United States District Court for the Eastern      District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that      the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may      not be applicable to cases involving national security. The      Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may      involve different policy and practical considerations from      the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should      be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security      cases. United States v. United States District Court for the      Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress      enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our      national security, while also protecting the civil liberties      and constitutional rights that we cherish.",

        "statement": "The President has spoken repeatedly and emotionally in      recent days about the need for intelligence professionals to      have clarity in the law. He has emphasized that it is not      fair to ask these men and women to operate in an uncertain      legal environment and that, in fact, legal uncertainty      hampers operational effectiveness and thereby jeopardizes our      national security. Yet legal uncertainty is exactly what will      result if Congress heeds the President's call to enact      legislation that replaces the obligation to use the      procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with      broad language about relying upon the President's      constitutional authority.       Before FISA was enacted, courts addressed the issue of      warrantless surveillance for domestic security purposes but      did not clearly resolve the scope of the President's      authority regarding foreign intelligence surveillance. FISA      was enacted in order to clarify this murky legal area by      setting forth a clear process for electronic surveillance of      foreign powers and agents of foreign powers. The Executive      Branch welcomed the clarity and this law has been viewed as      an essential national security tool for 28 years.       This legislation would return a complex subject to the      murky waters from which FISA emerged by making going to the      FISA court or applying FISA in any way optional rather than      mandatory. It leaves it to the President to decide when he      has the authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of      Americans or foreigners. Whether he has made the right      determination will not be known unless and until it is      challenged in court.       If advances in technology or other exigencies not      contemplated in FISA present the President with a national      security emergency, he should have a window in which to act      while promptly seeking appropriate amendments to FISA--and      this could be provided for in the statute. But this      extraordinary emergency authority should not be permitted      effectively to repeal FISA.       FISA was a political compromise between the Legislative and      Executive branches of government; unforeseen exigencies      should require those branches of government to continue to      coordinate, not condone unilateralism by either branch.      Indeed, the world has become so much more complex, both      technologically and socially, than it was in 1978, that      making FISA optional rather than mandatory would      significantly destabilize the balance struck then between law      and policy.       As individuals with extensive experience in national      security and intelligence, we strongly urge that the      requirements of FISA remain just that--requirements, not      options. Congress should continue to work to get the facts      and if, once they are provided, these facts demonstrate the      need for changes in the law, amend it only as needed to meet      genuine national security imperatives. Legal clarity is just      as essential in this context as any other in which      intelligence or law enforcement officers are asked to      operate. FISA provides that clarity and should not be      abandoned or amended in ways that render it irrelevant.

        "statement": "Baroness Williams of Crosby: My Lords, I too thank the      Deputy Leader of the House for the very forceful, although      not at all untypical, way in which she addressed the House.      We on these Benches share completely the objective of the      disarmament of Iraq. There is no question about that.       I want to remind the noble Baroness of the second part of      Resolution 1441. It states that Iraq should have, ``a final      opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under      relevant resolutions of the Council'', and that it has been      accordingly decided, ``to set up an enhanced inspection      regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified      completion the disarmament process''.       The difference between these Benches, the noble Lord, Lord      Howell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, is      straightforwardly that we believe that the present draft      resolutions pre-empt that process, that it is not yet      completed, and that there is still an opportunity to avoid      war. Let me say very clearly, in case there is any      misunderstanding, that we believe that we, as powerfully as      any other part of this House, have an obligation to our      troops to make absolutely certain that men and women are not      put into war, risking their lives, unless it can be shown to      be absolutely necessary to do so. It is to that that I intend      to address my remarks. The first question is whether we are      convinced that Iraq is an imminent and present threat. There      is no question but that it could be a potential threat,      although I must dispute briefly with the noble Lord, Lord      Howell of Guildford. Not only the CIA in the United States      but Ministers in this House have on more than one recent      occasion admitted that there is no clear evidence to link      Al'Qaeda to the Government of Iraq, much as we might find      things easier if that were so. That must be stated very      explicitly, because repeating a misconception over and again      does not turn that misconception into a truth. Therefore, I      doubt whether we can show that Iraq is an imminent threat.       If we are seeking imminent threat, I need only quote from a      very senior colleague of mine who is the head of the security      unit in the Belfer Center at Harvard University. Ash Carter      is a former National Security Agency assistant secretary. He      said: ``News reports late last week indicated that . . .      North Korea is trucking the fuel rods away where they can      neither be inspected nor entombed      by an airstrike . . . as this loose nukes disaster unfolds      and the options for dealing with it narrow, the world does      nothing''.       That is a much more imminent threat.       Secondly, we are not convinced that containment has failed.      I can quote from an authoritative source. These are the words      of the Prime Minister himself in November 2000: ``We believe      that the sanctions regime has effectively contained Saddam      Hussein in the last 10 years. During this time he has not      attacked his neighbours, nor used chemical weapons against      his own people''.--[Official Report, Commons, 1/11/00; col. ",

Since then, I have reviewed a large number of classified documents on this matter, and I am deeply concerned about the manner in which the Bush administration conducted its surveillance program. Therefore, I am pleased that this legislation preserves a role for the U.S. court system, which will review the documents produced by the White House and other relevant documents to decide independently whether the telecommunications companies acted in good faith when cooperating with the Government. Only after that review would the courts decide whether the telecommunications companies deserve any form of liability protection. Furthermore, the legislation authorizes a joint investigation by the Inspectors General from the U.S. Department of Justice, National Security Agency, Department of Defense, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence to review the past actions of the U.S. Government and report to Congress on their findings so that we may take appropriate action.",

        "statement": "Last week, in Rumsfeld vs. Hamdan, the Supreme Court      decided that the military commissions for the jihadist      detainees in Guantanamo Bay are not lawfully constructed. I      disagree. However the realities of maintaining international      support and ensuring domestic consensus on fighting the      global war demands we look for alternatives for detaining and      trying jihadists. Regardless of how the Court decided in      Hamdan, the commissions have failed.       The Court has forced the opponents of military commissions      to offer legitimate solutions. The best solution available is      the creation of a National Security Court system.       The global war on terror has created ambiguities in both      the laws of armed conflict and how best to fight this new      war. The asymmetric threat of international terror, the lack      of a clear national enemy, the problems with the military      commissions in Guantanamo Bay, allegations of torture and the      recent constitutional issues surrounding wiretap efforts of      the National Security Agency all highlight the lack of an      appropriate body of law to govern this new conflict. Nowhere      is this ambiguity more evident than in the United States'      handling of detainees.       The ``enemies'' in this war are men and women who fight not      for a nation but for ideology, do not wear standard military      uniforms and, as doctrine, flout the laws of war. These new      ``warriors'' have created extreme difficulties since they are      not conventional prisoners of war (regardless what the recent      ruling has asserted) and thus (with all due respect to      Justice John Paul Stevens) the Geneva Conventions simply do      not apply to them. Adjudicating their status and crimes has      become increasingly chaotic. It initially appeared that the      military tribunals (currently referred to as military      commissions by the Bush Administration) would provide the      appropriate venue for handling the prosecution of the      detainees. But now, over four years later, there has not been      a completed prosecution. More than 500 detainees remain in      Guantanamo Bay and supposedly another 450 are being held in      Afghanistan.       As this problem grows, the U.S. needs a new approach. Our      own federal courts system, the standard courts-martial system      and other traditional methods, won't work. A healthy,      bipartisan debate on ``what'' to do next is critical. This is      a new war, one that mixes law enforcement and warfare, and      does not fit neatly in either category.        A national security court apparatus needs to be legislated.      As Congress begins to debate (as ordered by the Supreme      Court) how to handle jihadists' violations of the laws of      war, policymakers must achieve both the reality and      appearance of justice.       Clearly, many issues need to be hammered out regarding the      composition of the court.       The court would be a hybrid of the military commissions and      our own federal trial system.       The jihadist would be afforded limited rights, including      right to counsel and be detained and tried on military bases      within the United States. The law would allow the death      penalty. The hearings would be closed with the exception of      observers from Human Rights Organizations (for example,      Amnesty International, the International Red Cross and the      U.N. Human Rights Watch.) The U.S. Department of Justice      would provide prosecutors and administer over the program.       International concern over Guantanamo is detracting from      our ability to provide guidance, counsel and policy in this      and other arenas. A blue-ribbon commission, created by the      president with bipartisan support from Congress, should      immediately be formed to address questions as to proper      detention, adjudication, intelligence gathering, terrorist      surveillance and other legal issues associated with the      threat of international terror.       The National Security Court, a natural outgrowth of the      military commissions, affords an opportunity for U.S. policy      makers to respond forcefully and effectively to calls for a      way out of the Guantanamo issue.       The Hamdan decision has pushed us in this direction. The      military commissions are no longer a viable option.       Rather than offering no solutions and merely attacking the      existing structure, policy makers need to emerge with fresh      ways to look at the proper detention and adjudication of the      jihadists.       It is time to regain the initiative, and reaffirm our      leadership in the humane prosecution of those who would      undermine the ideals of democracy.",

        "statement": "One of the most excruciating images of the September 11      attacks is the sight of a man who was trapped in one of the      World Trade Center towers. Stripped of his suit jacket and      tie and hanging on to what appears to be his office curtains,      he is seen trying to lower himself outside a window to the      floor immediately below. Frantically kicking his legs in an      effort to find a purchase, he loses his grip, and falls.       That horrific scene and thousands more were the images that      awakened a sleeping nation on that long, brutal morning.      Instead of overwhelming fear or paralyzing self-doubt, the      attacks were met with defiance, unity and a sense of moral      purpose. Following the heroic example of ordinary citizens      who put their fellow human beings and the public good ahead      of themselves, the country's leaders cast aside politics and      personal ambition and enacted the USA Patriot Act just 45      days later.       A mere four-and-a-half years after victims were forced to      choose between being burned alive and jumping from 90      stories, it is frankly shocking that there is anyone in      Washington who would politicize the Patriot Act. It is an      insult to those who died to tell the American people that the      organization posing the greatest threat to their liberty is      not al Qaeda but the FBI. Hearing any member of Congress      actually crow about ``killing'' or ``playing chicken'' with      this critical legislation is as disturbing today as it would      have been when Ground Zero was still smoldering. Today we      know in far greater detail what not having it cost us.       Critics contend that the Patriot Act was rushed into law in      a moment of panic. The truth is, the policies and guidelines      it corrected had a long, troubled history and everybody who      had to deal with them knew it. The ``wall'' was a tortuous      set of rules promulgated by Justice Department lawyers in      1995 and imagined into law by the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Conceived as an added      protection for civil liberties provisions already built into      the statute, it was the wall and its real-world ramifications      that hardened the failure-to-share culture between agencies,      allowing early information about 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-     Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi to fall through the cracks. More      perversely, even after the significance of these terrorists      and their presence in the country was known by the FBI's      intelligence division, the wall prevented it from talking to      its own criminal division in order to hunt them down.       Furthermore, it was the impenetrable FISA guidelines and      fear of provoking the FISA court's wrath if they were      transgressed that discouraged risk-averse FBI supervisors      from applying for a FISA search warrant in the Zacarias      Moussaoui case. The search, finally conducted on the      afternoon of 9/11, produced names and phone numbers of people      in the thick of the 9/11 plot, so many fertile clues that      investigators believe that at least one airplane, if not all      four, could have been saved.       In 2002, FISA's appellate level Court of Review examined      the entire statutory scheme for issuing warrants in national      security investigations and declared the ``wall'' a      nonsensical piece of legal overkill, based neither on express      statutory language nor reasonable interpretation of the FISA      statute. The lower court's attempt to micromanage the      execution of national security warrants was deemed an      assertion of authority which neither Congress or the      Constitution granted it. In other words, those lawyers and      judges who created, implemented and so assiduously enforced      the FISA guidelines were wrong and the American people paid      dearly for it.       Despite this history, some members of Congress contend that      this process-heavy court is agile enough to rule on quickly      needed National Security Agency (NSA) electronic surveillance      warrants. This is a dubious claim. Getting a FISA warrant      requires a multistep review involving several lawyers at      different offices within the Department of Justice. It can      take days, weeks, even months if there is a legal dispute      between the principals. ``Emergency'' 72-hour intercepts      require sign-offs by NSA lawyers and preapproval by the      attorney general before surveillance can be initiated.      Clearly, this is not conducive to what Gen. Michael Hayden,      principal deputy director of national intelligence, calls      ``hot pursuit'' of al Qaeda conversations.       The Senate will soon convene hearings on renewal of the      Patriot Act and the NSA terrorist surveillance program. A      minority of senators want to gamble with American lives and      ``fix'' national security laws, which they can't show are      broken. They seek to eliminate or weaken anti-terrorism      measures which take into account that the Cold War and its      slow-moving, analog world of landlines and stationary targets      is gone. The threat we face today is a completely new      paradigm of global terrorist networks operating in a high-     velocity digital age using the Web and fiber-optic      technology. After four-and-a-half years without another      terrorist attack, these senators think we're safe enough to      cave in to the same civil liberties lobby that supported that      deadly FISA wall in the first place. What if they, like those      lawyers and judges, are simply wrong?       Meanwhile, the media, mouthing phrases like ``Article II      authority,'' ``separation of powers'' and ``right to      privacy,'' are presenting the issues as if politics have      nothing to do with what is driving the subject matter and its      coverage. They want us to forget four years of relentless      ``connect-the-dots'' reporting about the missed chances that      ``could have prevented 9/11.'' They have discounted the      relevance of references to the two 9/11 hijackers who lived      in San Diego. But not too long ago, the media itself reported      that phone records revealed that five or six of the hijackers      made extensive calls overseas.       NBC News aired an ``exclusive'' story in 2004 that      dramatically recounted how al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, the San      Diego terrorists who would later hijack American Airlines      flight 77 and fly it into the Pentagon, received more than a      dozen calls from an al Qaeda ``switchboard'' inside Yemen      where al-Mihdhar's brother-in-law lived. The house received      calls from Osama Bin Laden and relayed them to operatives      around the world.       Senior correspondent Lisa Myers told the shocking story of      how, ``The NSA had the actual phone number in the United      States that the switchboard was calling, but didn't deploy      that equipment, fearing it would be accused of domestic      spying.'' Back then, the NBC script didn't describe it as      ``spying on Americans.'' Instead, it was called one of the      ``missed opportunities that could have saved 3,000 lives.''       Another example of opportunistic coverage concerns the      Patriot Act's ``library provision.'' News reports have given      plenty of ink and airtime to the ACLU's unsupported claims      that the government has abused this important records      provision. But how many Americans know that several of the      hijackers repeatedly accessed computers at public libraries      in New Jersey and Florida, using personal Internet accounts      to carry out the conspiracy? Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi logged      on four times at a college library in New Jersey where they      purchased airline tickets for AA 77 and later confirmed their      reservations on Aug. 30. In light of this, it is ridiculous      to suggest that the Justice Department has the time,      resources or interest in ``investigating the reading habits      of law abiding citizens.''       We now have the ability to put remote control cameras on      the surface of Mars. Why should we allow enemies to      annihilate us simply because we lack the clarity or resolve      to strike a reasonable balance between a healthy skepticism      of government power and the need to take proactive measures      to protect ourselves from such threats? The mantra of civil-     liberties hard-liners is to ``question authority''--even when      it is coming to our rescue--then blame that same authority      when, hamstrung by civil liberties laws, it fails to save us.      The old laws that would prevent FBI agents from stopping the      next al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were built on the bedrock of a      35-year history of dark, defeating mistrust. More Americans      should not die because the peace-at-any-cost fringe and      antigovernment paranoids still fighting the ghost of Nixon      hate George Bush more than they fear al Qaeda. Ask the      American people what they want. They will say that they want      the commander in chief to use all reasonable means to catch      the people who are trying to rain terror on our cities. Those      who cite the soaring principle of individual liberty do not      appear to appreciate that our enemies are not seeking to      destroy individuals, but whole populations.       Three weeks before 9/11, an FBI agent with the bin Laden      case squad in New York learned that al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi      were in this country. He pleaded with the national security      gatekeepers in Washington to launch a nationwide manhunt and      was summarily told to stand down. When the FISA      Court of Review tore down the wall in 2002, it included in      its ruling the agent's Aug. 29, 2001, email to FBI      headquarters: ``Whatever has happened to this--someday      someone will die--and wall or not--the public will not      understand why we were not more effective and throwing every      resource we had at certain problems. Let's hope the National      Security Law Unit will stand behind their decisions then,      especially since the biggest threat to us now, [bin Laden],      is getting the most `protection.' ''       The public has listened to years of stinging revelations      detailing how the government tied its own hands in stopping      the devastating attacks of September 11. It is an      irresponsible violation of the public trust for members of      Congress to weaken the Patriot Act or jeopardize the NSA      terrorist surveillance program because of the same illusory      theories that cost us so dearly before, or worse, for rank      partisan advantage. If they do, and our country sustains yet      another catastrophic attack that these antiterrorism tools      could have prevented, the phrase ``connect the dots'' will      resonate again--but this time it will refer to the trail of      innocent American blood which leads directly to the Senate      floor.",

(2) Contracting by the National Security Agency, in      particular--       (A) the extent of reliance by the Agency on contract      employees to carry out important aspects of the national      security mission of the Agency;       (B) the extent to which contractors with access to      classified information were properly vetted;       (C) the sufficiency of internal controls to ensure only      properly cleared contractors with a need to know had access      to classified information;       (D) whether adequate remedial measures have been put in      place to address identified deficiencies in the foregoing      areas; and       (E) whether any oversight or legislation is needed to      reform any issues identified by the use of Federal      contractors in the intelligence agencies.       (3) The nature and scope of National Security Agency      intelligence-collection programs, operations, and activities,      including intelligence-collection programs affecting      Americans, that were the subject matter of the unauthorized      disclosure, including--       (A) the extent of domestic surveillance authorized by law;       (B) the legal authority that served as the basis for the      National Security Agency intelligence-collection programs,      operations, and activities that are the subject matter of      those disclosures;       (C) the extent to which such programs, operations, and      activities that were the subject matter of such unauthorized      disclosures may have gone beyond what was authorized by law      or permitted under the Constitution of the United States;       (D) the extent and sufficiency of oversight of such      programs, operations, and activities by Congress and the      Executive Branch; and       (E) the need for greater transparency and more effective      congressional oversight of intelligence community activities.

(5) The terrorist activities that were disrupted, in whole      or in part, with the aid of information obtained through the      National Security Agency intelligence-collection programs,      operations, and activities that were the subject matter of      those disclosures and whether this information could have      been promptly obtained by other means.       (6) The findings and recommendations of the Review Group on      Intelligence and Communications Technologies established by      the President, including--       (A) the feasibility, costs, and benefits of such findings      and recommendations; and       (B) the legislative action that would be required to      implement those findings and recommendations.

It requires the inspectors general of the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, and the Director of National Intelligence to conduct a comprehensive review and issue a report on the President's surveillance program. It requires the intelligence community to create reverse targeting guidelines so that the National Security Agency cannot conduct surveillance of a U.S. citizen without a warrant by targeting a foreigner. Finally, it sunsets this legislation in 4\\1/2\\ half years rather than the 6 years called for in the original bill.

        "statement": "Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader      McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: As you and your      colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018.      we write as retired three and four star flag and general      officers from all branches of the armed services to share our      strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy      and development alongside defense are critical to keeping      America safe.       We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises      our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from      confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle      East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and      stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater      instability. There are 65 million displaced people today. the      most since World War II, with consequences including refugee      flows that are threatening America's strategic allies in      Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Europe.       The State Department. USAID, Millennium Challenge      Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are      critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put      our men and women in uniform in harm's way. As Secretary      James Mattis said while Commander of U.S. Central Command,      ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need      to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight      against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong      civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of      extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and      hopelessness.       We recognize that America's strategic investments in      diplomacy and development--like all of U.S. investments--must      be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been      undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in      recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan      support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls.      trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking. water. food      security. and transparency and accountability.       We urge you to ensure that resources for the International      Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and      opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.

Neither in the first year of his Presidency or in the aftermath of 9/11 or in the 4 years since enactment of the PATRIOT Act has President Bush come to Congress and asked us for authority to engage in the kind of extensive surveillance on Americans by the National Security Agency that The New York Times reported and the President has now confirmed that he secretly ordered and has reaffirmed more than 30 times.",

        "statement": "Dear Colleagues: Today is a difficult one for those of us      who serve the country in its intelligence services. An      article on the front page of The New York Times claims that      the National Security Agency has been collecting information      that violates the privacy and civil liberties of American      citizens. The release of documents from the Department of      Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) spells out in detail      harsh interrogation techniques used by CIA officers on      suspected al Qa'ida terrorists.       As the leader of the Intelligence Community, I am trying to      put these issues into perspective. We cannot undo the events      of the past; we must understand them and turn this      understanding to advantage as we move into the future.       It is important to remember the context of these past      events. All of us remember the horror of 9/11. For months      afterwards we did not have a clear understanding of the enemy      we were dealing with, and our every effort was focused on      preventing further attacks that would kill more Americans. It      was during these months that the CIA was struggling to obtain      critical information from captured al Qa'ida leaders, and      requested permission to use harsher interrogation methods.      The OLC memos make clear that senior legal officials judged      the harsher methods to be legal, and that senior policymakers      authorized their use. High value information came from      interrogations in which those methods were used and provided      a deeper understanding of the al Qa'ida organization that was      attacking this country. As the OLC memos demonstrate, from      2002 through 2006 when the use of these techniques ended, the      leadership of the CIA repeatedly reported their activities      both to Executive Branch policymakers and to members of      Congress, and received permission to continue to use the      techniques.       Those methods, read on a bright, sunny, safe day in April      2009, appear graphic and disturbing. As the President has      made clear, and as both CIA Director Panetta and I have      stated, we will not use those techniques in the future. I      like to think I would not have approved those methods in the      past, but I do not fault those who made the decisions at that      time, and I will absolutely defend those who carried out the      interrogations within the orders they were given.       Even in 2009 there are organizations plotting to kill      Americans using terror tactics, and although the memories of      9/11 are becoming more distant, we in the intelligence      services must stop them. One of our most effective tools in      discovering groups planning to attack us are their      communications, and it is the job of the NSA to intercept      them. The NSA does this vital work under legislation that was      passed by the Congress. The NSA actions are subject to      oversight by my office and by the Justice Department under      court-approved safeguards; when the intercepts are conducted      against Americans, it is with individual court orders. Under      these authorities the officers of the National Security      Agency collect large amounts of international      telecommunications, and under strict rules review and analyze      some of them. These intercepts have played a vital role in      many successes we have had in thwarting terrorist attacks      since 9/11.       On occasion. NSA has made mistakes and intercepted the      wrong communications. The numbers of these mistakes are very      small in terms of our overall collection efforts, but each      one is investigated, Congress and the courts are notified,      corrective measures are taken, and improvements are put in      place to prevent reoccurrences.       As a young Navy officer during the Vietnam years, I      experienced public scorn for those of us who served in the      Armed Forces during an unpopular war. Challenging and      debating the wisdom and policies linked to wars and      warfighting is important and legitimate; however, disrespect      for those who serve honorably within legal guidelines is not.      I remember well the pain of those of us who served our      country even when the policies we were carrying out were      unpopular or could be second-guessed.       We in the Intelligence Community should not be subjected to      similar pain. Let the debate focus on the law and our      national security. Let us be thankful that we have public      servants who seek to do the difficult work of protecting our      country under the explicit assurance that their actions are      both necessary and legal.       There will almost certainly be more media articles about      the actions of intelligence agencies in the past, and as we      do our vital work of protecting the country we will make      mistakes that will also be reported. What we must do is make      it absolutely clear to the American people that our ethos is      to act legally, in as transparent a manner as we can, and in      a way that they would be proud of if we could tell them the      full story,       It is my job, and the job of our national leaders, to      ensure that the work done by the Intelligence Community is      appreciated and supported. You can be assured the President      knows this and is supporting us. It is your responsibility to      continue the difficult, often dangerous and vital work you      are doing every day.           Sincerely,                                                  Dennis C. Blair.",

        "statement": "Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate my views on      the meaning and intent of the provisions we added to this      legislation since the Governmental Affairs Committee first      considered the bill in May and filed the accompanying report      to S. 2452. This legislation has been almost a year in the      making, and reflects the thoughtful contributions of an array      of distinguished legislators and policy experts.       Last October, I introduced legislation with Senator Specter      to create a Department of Homeland Security (S. 1534). That      legislation drew heavily on the recommendations of the United      States Commission on National Security/21st Century, also      known as the Hart-Rudman Commission. It called for a new      department made up of the Coast Guard, Customs, Border      Patrol, and FEMA, as well as some smaller offices that      specialize in critical infrastructure protection and      emergency preparedness. The compelling need for such a      department was quickly underscored in a series of hearings      before the Governmental Affairs Committee examining aspects      of homeland security. Whether the subject was anthrax in the      mail, port security, or critical infrastructure protection,      the Federal government generally did not have a strong,      coordinated approach to address the range of threats. A      strong, Cabinet-level department encompassing key programs      related to homeland security would be a vital first step to      addressing this deficiency. At the same time, however, it      became apparent that no single department could address all      of the Federal programs engaged in the war on terrorism.      Therefore, I combined forces with Sen. Graham, who had      proposed legislation to create a White House terrorism office      to coordinate federal efforts to combat terrorism government-     wide. In contrast to the position created by executive order      for Gov. Ridge, this office would be a Senate-confirmed      position with full accountability and authority, as well as      statutory power to review federal budgets relating to      terrorism. The combined legislation, the ``National Homeland      Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002,'' was      introduced on May 2, 2002. It was considered by the      Governmental Affairs Committee on May 22, 2002 and reported      out on a 7-3 vote. A full account of the background and      history of that legislation is included in its accompanying      report, No. 107-175.       Before the full Senate had a chance to consider that bill,      however, the President announced his support for a Department      of Homeland Security. That announcement was followed, on June      18, with a legislative proposal from the administration. The      administration's bill encompassed almost all of S. 2452's      organizational elements regarding a Department of Homeland      Security. It went further, however, and proposed that      additional programs and agencies be transferred to the new      department. To ensure that these new administration proposals      were properly considered, the Governmental Affairs Committee      held four additional hearings. Then, working with other      committee chairmen and ranking members, I prepared an      amendment to S. 2452 that was considered at a July 24-25      business meeting of the Governmental Affairs Committee. That      expanded version of S. 2452 went a considerable way to      incorporate Administration proposals that had not been part      of the original bill. It was further amended during two days      of Committee deliberation, and ultimately endorsed by a      bipartisan Committee vote of 12 to 5.       What follows is a description of some of the key changes to      the legislation since the May 22, 2002 markup of S. 2452. It      should be considered in concert with Report 107-175, which      describes the core of the legislation--most of which is      unchanged. A complete section-by-section analysis is also      included.       As reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee (GAC)      on May 22nd, S. 2452 created a Department of Homeland      Security with three directorates: Border and Transportation      Protection, Critical Infrastructure Protection, and Emergency      Preparedness and Response. The GAC-endorsed legislation now      includes additional programs and agencies that will be      organized into six directorates: the original three, plus      directorates for Intelligence, Immigration and Science and      Technology, an expanded version of a Science and Technology      Office in the original bill. The key changes are summarized      below:       The GAC-endorsed legislation adds the Transportation      Security Administration (TSA) to the agencies incorporated      into the Directorate for Border and Transportation      Protection. TSA was created through the Aviation and      Transportation Security Act, Pub. L. 107-71, which was signed      into law on November 19, 2001. The agency's mission is to      protect the country's transportation systems, including rail,      highways, and maritime, although currently its main focus is      to improve aviation safety. TSA's responsibilities include      meeting a series of deadlines to upgrade aviation security,      including the hiring of more than 30,000 airport security      personnel, deploying explosive detection systems and other      security equipment, facilitating airport passenger and      baggage inspection, and implementing other measures to      heighten the safety of air travel.       The inclusion of TSA in the Department will permit better      coordination of transportation security operations with other      agencies that are responsible for security at the borders.      These agencies, which include the Customs Service, Coast      Guard, Border Patrol, INS, and border inspection agents from      the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, are      responsible for conducting inspections of travelers and goods      entering the United States and for securing the international      boundaries the United States shares with Mexico and Canada.      TSA's mission to secure our transportation infrastructure is      closely tied to maintaining the security of the ports of      entry where these border agencies are stationed. For example,      cargo containers that pass through our ports are conveyed to      other parts of the country through our transportation system,      either on rail or the highways, and could cause significant      harm and disruption to our transportation infrastructure if      they contained explosives or were used in a terrorist attack.      It is essential for these agencies to coordinate their      efforts so that security measures are linked and more      seamlessly implemented. This process will be easier with TSA      and the key border agencies in the same chain of command.       Our transportation system must also be able to move people      and goods quickly and efficiently from the borders throughout      the country. To ensure the security of this system, TSA needs      access to key information regarding vulnerabilities and      threats. The Department's Directorate of Intelligence, which      I will describe shortly, will have the intelligence      architecture to help provide this critical information to TSA      and other agencies within the Department. By being closely      tied to that intelligence directorate, and to the other      border agencies in the Department that will be collecting      vital information, TSA will be in a better position to      prevent future attacks using the transportation system.       Finally, as a new agency TSA may be able to take advantage      of some economies of scale offered by the new Department.      Specifically, it may not need to create certain      capabilities--administrative or otherwise--that will already      exist in other components of the Department.       In S. 2452, the Customs Service was transferred intact to      the Department. This remains the case in the GAC-endorsed      legislation, which also provides that Customs will be      preserved as a distinct entity.       At the request of the Senate Finance Committee Chairman and      Ranking Member, the legislation incorporates an amendment,      adopted by the Committee and agreed to by both the White      House and the Finance Committee Chairman and Ranking Member,      which will preserve the ability of the Treasury Secretary--     with the concurrence of the Secretary--to issue regulations      on customs revenue functions that involve economic judgments      within the expertise of the Treasury Department, and which      can have a major impact on our economy and relationships with      foreign countries. These customs revenue functions include:      assessing, collecting, and refunding duties, taxes, and fees      on imported goods; administering import quotas and labeling      requirements; collecting import data needed to compile      international trade statistics; and administering reciprocal      trade agreements and trade preference legislation. The      Customs Service, reporting to the Secretary, is responsible      for administering and enforcing these laws, and indeed      for all the Custom Service's traditional border and revenue      operations; the Commissioner of Customs is also authorized to      develop and support the issuance of regulations by the      Treasury Secretary regarding customs revenue functions. After      further review, Congress may consider legislation to      determine the appropriate allocation of these regulatory      authorities between the Secretary of Homeland Security and      the Treasury Secretary.       The legislation transfers the Federal Law Enforcement      Training Center (FLETC) from the Department of the Treasury      to the Directorate for Border and Transportation Protection.      FLETC provides basic and advanced agency-specific training      for law enforcement officers and analysts at over 70 Federal      agencies. This training allows for greater standardization of      law enforcement training that is also more cost-effective and      is taught by professional instructors using modern      facilities. Many of its key customer agencies are being      transferred to the new Department, including the Secret      Service, INS, Border Patrol, Customs Service, Coast Guard,      and Federal Protective Service. Given these relationships,      the Department will benefit from the inclusion of FLETC.       FLETC also provides training to State and local entities      and to foreign law enforcement personnel, programs generally      not otherwise available to these agencies. The programs also      enhance networking and cooperation throughout the law      enforcement community, domestically as well as world-wide.      Therefore, these programs will support and complement the      Department's efforts to work more closely with State and      local agencies as well as foreign governments to detect and      prevent acts of terrorism.       The legislation transfers the Coast Guard to the new      Department, and specifies that it be maintained as a distinct      entity. At the July 24-25 business meeting, the Committee      adopted language intended to maintain the structural and      operational integrity of the Coast Guard and the authority of      the Commandant, ensure continuation of the non-homeland      security missions of the Coast Guard and the Service's      capabilities to carry out these missions as it is transferred      to the new Department, and ensure that the Commandant reports      to the Secretary.       The language, offered as an amendment by Senators Stevens      and Collins, states that the Secretary may not make any      significant change to any of the non-homeland security      missions and capabilities of the Coast Guard without the      prior approval of the Congress in a subsequent statute. The      President may waive this restriction for no more than 90 days      upon his declaration and certification to the Congress that a      clear, compelling, and immediate state of national emergency      exists that justifies such a waiver.       The language further directs that the Coast Guard's      organizational structure, units, personnel, and non-homeland      security missions shall be maintained intact and without      reduction after the transfer unless Congress specifies      otherwise in subsequent Acts. The language also states that      Coast Guard personnel, ships, aircraft, helicopters, and      vehicles may not be transferred to the operational control      of, or diverted to the principal and continuing use of,      any other organization, unit, or entity of the Department.       Upon the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department, the      Commandant shall report directly to the Secretary and not      through any other official of the Department.       The Inspector General of the Department shall annually      assess the Coast Guard's performance of all its missions with      a particular emphasis on examining the non-homeland security      missions.       None of the conditions in the approved language shall apply      when the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy under      section 3 of title 14, United States Code.       The legislation creates a separate directorate for      intelligence (DI) to serve as a national level focal point      for information available to the government relating to the      plans, intentions, and capabilities of terrorists and      terrorist organizations. To emphasize its importance to all      aspects of Homeland Security, the DI is an independent      directorate within the Department, and is headed by an Under      Secretary who reports to the Secretary.       This directorate is a new addition to the legislation since      the May 22 markup. It stems from the Administration's      proposal to create an intelligence analysis unit within the      Department. However, the President's concept has been altered      and strengthened in response to testimony before the      Committee and input from key senators. Specifically, this      proposal reflects important input from Senators Levin and      Akaka, both in negotiations and amendments offered at the      business meeting. In addition, Intelligence Chairman Senator      Graham, Intelligence Vice Chairman Senator Shelby, former      Intelligence Chairman Senator Specter and Senator Durbin      contributed key ideas.       As an independent directorate--without the operational      responsibilities of other directorates--the DI will focus on      providing intelligence analysis to all of the other      directorates in the Department, to State and local      government, and to law enforcement, for the purpose of      preventing terrorist attacks, enhancing border security,      protecting critical infrastructure, enhancing emergency      preparedness and response, and better informing our research      and development activities.       It is important to note that the new Department, through      its component organizations, will be one of the largest      generators in the government of information relevant to      terrorism. The data it obtains about persons and goods      entering the country must be better organized and coordinated      with threat data from other agencies if the new Department is      going to be able to do its job. The DI, therefore, will be      responsible for receiving and analyzing law enforcement      information from agencies of the United States government,      State and local government agencies (including law      enforcement agencies), and the private sector, and fusing      such information and analysis with analytical products,      assessments, and warnings concerning foreign intelligence      from the CIA's Counterterrorist Center in order to detect and      identify threats of terrorism and other threats to homeland      security. The Counterterrorist Center shall have primary      responsibility for the analysis of foreign intelligence      relating to international terrorism. However, the DI may also      conduct its own supplemental analysis of foreign intelligence      relating to threats of terrorism against the United States      and other threats to homeland security.       The DI's mission is critical to all the Department's      activities, as well as to the homeland security mission of      the intelligence community, law enforcement community, and      State and local governments. For this reason, unless the      President directs otherwise, the Secretary is provided with      broad, routine access to reports, assessments, analytical      information, and other information--including unevaluated      intelligence--from the intelligence community and other      United States government agencies. The Secretary will also      receive information from State and local government agencies,      and the private sector. As the President may further provide,      the Secretary is also authorized to request additional      information--either information that an agency already has in      its possession, or new information that could require further      investigation. The Secretary will work with the Director of      Central Intelligence and the Attorney General to ensure that      all material received by the Department is protected against      unauthorized disclosure and that sources and methods are      protected.       The provision also reflects an amendment by Senator Akaka      that makes the Department a full participant in the process,      managed by the Director of Central Intelligence, whereby the      intelligence community establishes overall requirements and      priorities for the collection of national intelligence.      Similarly, the Akaka amendment also makes the Directorate      responsible for consulting with the Attorney General and      other officials to establish overall collection priorities      and strategies for information, including law enforcement      information, relating to domestic threats.       The intelligence proposal reflected in the GAC-endorsed      legislation was developed after examining the      Administration's proposal and hearing from expert witnesses      on the critical need for a national level focal point for the      analysis of all information available to the United States to      combat terrorism. On June 26 and 27, the Committee held      hearings on how to shape the intelligence functions of the      proposed Department--to determine how, in light of the      failure of our government to bring all of the information      available to various agencies together prior to September 11      the government should receive information from the field,      both foreign and domestic, and convert it, through analysis,      into actionable information that better protects our      security.       The Committee heard testimony from former directors of the      Defense Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency,      from FBI Director Mueller and Director of Central      Intelligence Tenet, and from William Webster--who headed both      the FBI and CIA. It also heard from the Chairman and Vice-     Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senators Bob Graham      and Richard Shelby, whose investigation into the failures of      September 11 is expected to yield recommendations for broader      reforms that address long-standing and systemic problems      within the intelligence community.       Senator Graham's written testimony stated that the      Intelligence Committee's hearings thus far have uncovered      several factors that contributed to the failures of September      11--one of which is ``the absence of a single set of eyes to      analyze all the bits and pieces of relevant intelligence      information, including open source material.'' Senator      Shelby's written testimony stated that ``most Americans would      probably be surprised to know that even nine months after the      terrorist attacks, there is today no federal official, not a      single one, to whom the President can turn to ask the simple      question, what do we know about current terrorist threats      against our homeland? No one person or entity has meaningful      access to all such information the government possesses. No      one really knows what we know, and no one is even in a      position to go to find out.'' General Patrick Hughes, former      director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, echoed these      points. His testimony stated that, ``in our intelligence      community, we currently have an inadequate capability to      process, analyze, prepare in contextual and technical forms      that make sense and deliver cogent intelligence to users      as soon as possible so that the time dependent operational      demands for intelligence are met.''       The Administration's approach falls short of what we need.      A key concern is the mission and position of the intelligence      unit      within the new Department. By making intelligence its own      directorate, our legislation recognizes that the work it does      will be instrumental to every other directorate in the      organization and to state and local authorities--not just to      federal infrastructure protection efforts. The      Administration's proposal imbeds the intelligence division      within a directorate responsible for critical infrastructure      protection. The Administration's proposal is to create an      ``information analysis and critical infrastructure protection      division''--whose most important role, as CIA Director Tenet      testified before the Committee on June 27, would be ``to      translate assessments about evolving terrorist targeting      strategies, training, and doctrine overseas into a system of      protection for the infrastructure of the United States.'' But      that is not enough. Intelligence will be crucial not only to      infrastructure protection, but to everything this Department      will do. It is not hard to imagine many threats to American      lives that do not involve infrastructure at all: a plot to      detonate a bomb in a shopping mall, for instance, or to      unleash a biological agent on a city from above.       To be most effective, the entity responsible for producing      all-sources intelligence analysis should not be charged with      implementing operational responsibilities. The danger in the      Administration's approach is that the intelligence analysis      function will be consumed by the operational needs of      critical infrastructure protection, and not focus enough on      other aspects of the homeland security fight.       There is also a practical reason why these two functions      should be under different Under Secretaries. Both are very      complex functions that have never before been performed in      our government. These are very demanding jobs and the GAC      endorsed amendment places them under different Under      Secretaries so that, like border and transportation security,      science and technology, immigration, and emergency      preparedness and response, they will receive the focused      leadership and attention necessary to succeed. Just      protecting our cyber assets--which is only one aspect of      critical infrastructure--is a daunting challenge that grows      more each year.       The Under Secretary for Intelligence, who will have to      establish and operate a robust Directorate of Intelligence to      systematically analyze the threats to our country will be      fully consumed with that function. The Under Secretary for      Critical Infrastructure Protection, whose role will be to map      the threat information to the vulnerabilities in our critical      infrastructure, and work closely with other agencies, and the      private sector to ensure adequate protective measures are put      in place, will also have a huge challenge. However, by making      the same official responsible for establishing a robust      intelligence division and protecting critical infrastructure,      the Administration's proposal underestimates the challenges      that we face in both areas.       Secondly, the President's proposal does not allow the DI      sufficient, routine access to information produced by other      parts of the Intelligence Community and other agencies. The      GAC-endorsed legislation provides the Secretary with broad,      routine access to reports, assessments, analytical      information, and other information--including unevaluated      intelligence--relating to the capabilities, intentions, and      activities of terrorists and terrorist organizations, unless      otherwise directed by the President. ``Unevaluated      intelligence'' refers to the substance of intelligence      reports, absent any information about sources and methods. We      use this term based on the recommendation of the Chairman of      the Senate Intelligence Committee--precisely to make it clear      that information about sources and methods, which is      generally included in ``raw intelligence'', will be      protected. In contrast, the Administration's proposal would      curtail the Secretary's access to unanalyzed information. The      Secretary would have routine access to reports, assessments,      and analytical information. But, except for information      concerning vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure, the      Secretary would receive access to unanalyzed information only      as the President may further provide.       At the Committee's hearing on June 27, Senator Shelby, the      Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, objected to the      limitations on information access in the President's      proposal. He stated that ``unlike information relating to      infrastructure or other vulnerabilities to terrorist attack--     all of which the Secretary would be given access to `whether      or not such information has been analyzed'--information on      terrorist threats themselves would be available to the      Department only in the form of what is known as `finished'      intelligence.'' He testified that, under Sec. 203 of the      President's proposal, the Secretary may obtain the underlying      information only `by request' or when the President      specifically provides for its transmission to the new      Department. Senator Shelby called these limitations in the      President's bill ``unacceptable''. Clearly, the      Administration's proposal would reinforce tendencies not to      share information among agencies that have historically been      reluctant to share. Our purpose is to remove obstacles to      information sharing--obstacles that clearly contributed to      the tragedy of September 11--not to reinforce them.       The GAC-endorsed amendment establishes a proactive DI. In      addition to helping set intelligence priorities and receiving      analysis from all other agencies in government, it would have      routine access to the unevaluated intelligence, the      information behind the reports that DHS will receive, unless      the President directs otherwise. The Secretary will also be      able to request and receive additional information (as the      President further provides) that might require agencies to      conduct separate investigations or redeploy resources. We      anticipate that the cases would be rare where an agency is      unwilling or unable to comply with the Secretary's request;      however, the President will ultimately determine how      conflicts, if any, will be resolved.       During the July 24-25 business meeting, Senator Thompson      offered an amendment reflecting the President's approach on      intelligence; however that amendment was defeated.       S. 2452 included a Directorate for Critical Infrastructure      Protection (CIP). The GAC endorsed amendment continues to      include that directorate, and expands it to incorporate      significant additions as proposed by the President. The      Directorate will be headed by an Under Secretary who is      appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the      Senate.       The CIP will combine the key entities, currently scattered      across the Federal government, that are charged with working      with the private sector and other agencies to protect various      sectors of our nation's critical infrastructure. The      authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of several      offices are transferred to the Department. These include the      Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office of the Department of      Commerce (established by Presidential Decision Directive 63      in 1998 to coordinate federal initiatives on critical      infrastructure); and the National Infrastructure Protection      Center of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (other than the      Computer Investigations and Operations Section, which the      Administration requested remain in the FBI to ensure that      it continues to have a capability to pursue computer      crimes). To these we have added several important entities      from the President's proposal: (1) the National      Communications System of the Department of Defense      (established by Executive Order in 1984 to assist the      President and others in: (a) the exercise of      telecommunications functions and (b) coordinating the      planning for and provision of national security and      emergency preparedness communications); (2) the Computer      Security Division of the National Institute of Standards      and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce (which      is tasked with improving information systems security);      (3) The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis      Center of the Department of Energy (established to serve      as a source of national competence to address critical      infrastructure protection and continuity through support      for activities related to counterterrorism, threat      assessment, and risk mitigation); (4) The Federal Computer      Incident Response Center of the General Service      Administration (a partnership of computer incident      response, security, and law enforcement personnel to share      information and handle computer security incidents); and      (5) The Energy Security and Assurance Program of the      Department of Energy, a national security program to help      reduce America's energy supply vulnerability from severe      disruptions due to natural or malevolent causes.       Finally, the GAC endorsed legislation transfers the Federal      Protective Service of the General Services Administration      (GSA) to the CIP. The President proposed that FPS be      transferred to the Border and Transportation Protection      Directorate. The Federal Protective Service oversees security      at Federal property managed by GSA. Its expertise and mission      is to provide physical security for some of our nation's key      resources, making it more appropriate that it be combined      with the other entities responsible for physical security and      cyber security in this Directorate.       The GAC endorsed legislation establishes specialized      research and analysis units in the CIP to process      intelligence and identify vulnerabilities in key areas,      including: (a) Public health, (b) food and water storage,      production, and distribution; (c) commerce systems, including      banking and finance; (d) energy systems, including electric      power and oil and gas production and storage; (e)      transportation systems, including pipelines; (f) information      and communication systems; (g) continuity of government      services; and (h) other systems or facilities the destruction      of which would cause substantial hard to health, safety,      property, or the environment.       Among its other duties, the CIP shall be responsible for      receiving relevant information from the Directorate of      Intelligence, law enforcement, and other information to      assess the vulnerabilities of the key resources and critical      infrastructures; identifying priorities and supporting      protective measures by the Department and other entities;      developing a comprehensive national plan for securing key      resources and critical infrastructure; enhancing and sharing      of information regarding cyber-security and physical      security; developing security standards, tracking      vulnerabilities, proposing improved risk management policies;      and delineating the roles of various governmental agencies in      preventing, defending, and recovering from attacks.       The Directorate will also be responsible for establishing      the necessary organizational structure to provide leadership      and focus on both cyber-security and physical security, and      ensuring the maintenance of a nucleus of      cyber and physical security experts in the United States      Government. Both cyber and physical security are critical to      the adequate protection of those systems on which our      nation's economy and culture depend. The CIP will be      responsible for utilizing the best modeling, simulation, and      analytic tools to prioritize the effort.       The creation of this Directorate indicates broad consensus      on the need for a single entity to coordinate a national      effort to secure America's critical infrastructure. This is a      shared responsibility of Federal, State, and local      governments along with a private sector which owns 85% of our      nation's critical infrastructure. However, unlike the      President's proposal, which combines information analysis and      infrastructure protection under one Under Secretary, the GAC      amendment places Critical Infrastructure Protection in its      own directorate where it will work closely with the      Intelligence Directorate. This was done both to elevate and      stress the centrality of intelligence analysis to all of the      Department's missions, but also because critical      infrastructure protection is a sufficiently complex and      daunting challenge that it will require the focused      leadership and attention of an Under Secretary.       As reported out of the Committee in May, S. 2452 would have      transferred the law enforcement programs of the Immigration      and Naturalization Service to the new Department, while      leaving its service functions at the Department of Justice.      However, key senators and immigration experts argued that      this course could undermine the critical task of reforming      the INS. The GAC-endorsed legislation now transfers all      immigration functions to the new Department, but specifies      that the INS be disbanded and reorganized along the lines of      a major, bipartisan reform bill, S. 2444, sponsored by      Senators Kennedy and Brownback. These senators are the      chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the immigration      subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and have      assembled an impressive bipartisan majority of that committee      in support of their legislation. Rather than try to      characterize their handiwork for them, I am attaching a      letter from Senators Kennedy and Brownback describing the      substance of the immigration reforms now incorporated in this      legislation.       Because the work of reforming INS is very demanding, the      immigration programs will be in their own directorate, with      direct accountability to the Secretary, rather than included      as part of the Border and Transportation Protection      directorate. However, to ensure adequate coordination between      immigration programs and other agencies that operate at the      border, the legislation creates a Border Security Working      Group. This Working Group will consist primarily of the      Secretary, or his designee, and the Under Secretaries for      Immigration and Border and Transportation Protection. It will      meet at least four times a year, and coordinate matters      including budget requests, staffing requirements, and use of      equipment. This working group can also bring in other federal      agencies with border operations (such as the Drug Enforcement      Administration or the Food and Drug Administration) that are      not part of the Department, offering a critical mechanism for      government-wide coordination along the border and at ports of      entry.       The legislation also gives the Secretary regulatory      authority over the visa application process. Consular      employees at the Department of State would continue to      process visa applications. However, the Secretary would have      authority to issue regulations concerning the application      process. This would include the required procedures for      considering an application, such as whether all applicants      must be interviewed in person or what kind of      identification documents would be required. In addition,      the Secretary would have authority to station Departmental      employees oversees to consult with State Department      employees on the visa process and specific threats.       The homeland security mission will face profound      technological needs and requirements, and the challenges are      substantial. The first challenge derives from the fact that      most research and development of new technologies relevant to      homeland security will occur outside the new Department--in      other agencies, academia, and the private sector. Therefore,      the Department will require powerful tools and mechanisms to      elicit cooperation from entities external to the Department,      and to coordinate R efforts across a range of disparate      groups, each with their own missions and priorities, in      service to homeland security goals. The legislation attempts      to provide the Directorate of Science and Technology with the      mechanisms it needs to resolve this fundamental coordination      problem. The legislation establishes a Security Advanced      Research Projects Agency (SARPA), which is inspired by the      highly successful Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency      (DARPA) of the Department of Defense (DOD). Following the      DARPA model, SARPA will have funding, in the form of an      Acceleration Fund, to support key homeland security R both      within and outside of the federal government, and to leverage      collaboration on R between entities, particularly among the      agencies. A second mechanism provided under the legislation      is a Science and Technology Council consisting of senior R      officials from the agencies and other appropriate entities.      The Council will assist the Under Secretary in coordinating      interagency efforts to execute the science and technology      agenda of the Department, primarily through supporting the      development of a comprehensive technology roadmap for      establishing common priorities and allocating individual      responsibilities. Another important mechanism is the ability      to directly engage any of the Department of Energy (DOE)      national laboratory and sites through joint sponsorship      agreements in carrying out R activities for homeland      security purposes. With respect to bioterrorism research, the      Secretary will be able to ensure that the best researchers      are focused on developing necessary countermeasures against      biothreats by establishing general priorities for biothreat      research programs conducted at the National Institutes of      Health.       A second R challenge is to assure that the Directorate      will have expedient access to broad, deep, and ongoing      support for critical analysis and decision-making regarding      scientific or technical issues. To address this issue, the      legislation provides authority for the Directorate to      contract with or establish Federally Funded Research and      Development Centers (FFRDCs) to obtain independent      analytical, scientific, and technical expertise and support,      including support for risk analysis and risk management      functions. In addition, an Office of Risk Analysis and      Assessment is created within the Directorate to ensure that      such risk analysis functions are given institutional priority      and conducted internally or through outsourcing to FFRDCs.       A third challenge is for the Department to develop and      effectively manage a critical mass of internal homeland      security R capabilities. The legislation transfers a number      of entities from the Department of Energy, and one to be      created in the Department of Defense, that will constitute a      core scientific base upon which the Department will conduct      in-house R efforts central to its mission. Fundamental to      developing this in-house expertise is the ability to procure      a strong talent base and to engage them in innovative      projects quickly. In view of this, the legislation affords      the Secretary with flexible management tools to hire and      retain top flight scientific and technical personnel, as well      as to accelerate R and prototype projects to advance the      homeland security mission.       Intelligent and coordinated deployment of technology within      the Department is a fourth challenge that must be overcome.      Too often, government agencies are hampered and distracted      from their fundamental missions as a result of unstructured      and technically unsophisticated approaches to technology      acquisition and deployment that lead to interoperability      problems downstream. The legislation establishes an Office      for Technology Evaluation and Transition to assist the Under      Secretary in his responsibilities as the chief technology      officer and to assure his central role in testing,      evaluating, and approving new homeland security technologies      being considered by the Department for acquisition.       Lastly, the Committee recognizes that a sea of scientific      and technological expertise and resources resides outside the      walls of the Federal government, and has therefore included      several provisions to engage the private sector in      maintaining our national security. Transition of technology      is emphasized throughout the section. An Advisory Panel      consisting of experts from the private sector and academia      may be convened by the Secretary to advise the Under      Secretary and Council and promote communication with non-     federal entities. The Office of Technology Evaluation and      Transition described earlier will provide a gateway and      clearinghouse for companies with innovative technologies      relating to homeland security. This Office will also have      particular responsibility for facilitating the transition of      technologies into fielded systems for use by the Department,      other agencies, or private sector entities. Another provision      requires the Secretary to articulate a strategy and plan for      encouraging biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical companies,      and other entities to develop countermeasures against      biological and chemical weapons, with a view towards      commercial production. A fourth provision directs the Under      Secretary to establish a National Emergency Technology Guard      composed of teams of volunteer experts in science and      technology to assist local communities in responding to and      recovering from disasters requiring specialized scientific or      technical skills.       Taken in combination, the mechanisms granted by the      legislation provide the Department with an array of tools      with which to forcefully tackle the set of R challenges      confronting it. The legislative history and specific details      regarding the legislation are discussed in greater detail      below.       S. 2452, as reported out of the Committee on May 22,      contained a provision establishing an Office of Science and      Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security.      The underlying intent of this provision was to create an R      entity similar in organization and function to the Defense      Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was selected as an      appropriate model for the Department's R component in light      of the fact that the Department, as originally contemplated,      would have had limited capability to conduct R internally.      Consequently, it was determined that the Department could      most effectively initiate and promote R in support of its      mission through a DARPA-like entity with a lean, flexible      organizational structure joined with funding to leverage      external interagency collaboration. Since the release of the      President's proposal for the Department, and in      response to that and additional input received by the      Committee from a broad range of contributors, including      other Member offices and experts from the scientific      research and technology communities, the scope and      responsibilities of the Office have been broadened.       The legislation redesignates the Office of Science and      Technology as the ``Directorate of Science and Technology''      (``Directorate''), and elevates the head of the Directorate      to the rank of a Senate-confirmed Under Secretary. This      follows the consensus view of the National Academy of      Sciences that the Directorate's chief science and technology      (S) official requires sufficient stature to influence and      coordinate S policies and activities outside the      Department. The Under Secretary will be responsible for      executing the Directorate's mission of managing and      supporting R activities to meet national homeland security      needs and objectives; articulating national R goals,      priorities, and strategies pursuant to the mission of the      Department; coordinating with entities within and outside      government to advance the R agenda of the Department;      advising the Secretary of the Department on all scientific      and technical matters; facilitating the transfer and      deployment of technologies critical to homeland security      needs; and generally serving as the Department's chief      technology officer.       The legislation provides a number of key components to      assist the Directorate in meeting its mission. First among      these is SARPA, the new R agency modeled after DARPA that      was established in the original version of the legislation      and is retained in the amended legislation. DARPA was created      in 1958 in response to the launch of Sputnik. It is an      organization that recruits outstanding scientific and      technical talent and funds high-risk, high-payoff projects      that offer the potential for revolutionary advances. DARPA's      nimble, aggressive and creative approach has consistently      produced impressive and effective war-fighting technologies.      Moreover, in the course of fulfilling its central mission,      DARPA has developed technologies with broad commercial and      societal application, such as the Internet. Of particular      significance to the Committee in selecting DARPA as a model      for the S apparatus in the Department is DARPA's use of its      funding to leverage R investments in other parts of DOD,      effectively generating a multiplier effect that maximizes      DARPA's contribution to national defense in disproportion to      its actual funding level. Over five decades, DARPA has been      recognized as one of the most productive engines of      technological innovation in the U.S. government.       While DARPA concentrates primarily on the development of      revolutionary technologies, SARPA will have a broader focus      consistent with its larger mission. Since there are many      technologies relevant to homeland security in various stages      of development and deployment, SARPA will promote a wide      range of technology development, transition, and deployment      efforts, as well as research for revolutionary new      technologies. Nevertheless, the Committee anticipates that      with an Acceleration Fund authorized at $200 million for      FY03, SARPA will have the foundation for replicating or      exceeding DARPA's success in catalyzing critical new      technologies by initiating and leveraging R among public,      private, or university innovators. Under an amendment offered      by Senator Stevens, ten percent of the Acceleration Fund is      to be allocated to Coast Guard homeland security R missions      for FY'04 and FY'05 through a joint agreement with the      Commandant of the Coast Guard.       While Congress should restrain itself in directing      particular management strategies, it is the Committee's      expectation that SARPA will take full advantage of evolving      modern management strategies in the R field, particularly      in assuring effective technology transition. For example, the      Committee would expect SARPA to engage in a careful ``needs      identification'' effort which involves eventual technology      ``users'' in its R roadmapping and planning exercises. The      Committee also expects that it operate not simply as a      traditional research organization but that it explore methods      to involve venture participants, incubate new technologies,      encourage the startup process, facilitate prototyping, and      promote strategic government and private sector supporters      and investors. SARPA will also need to actively encourage      connections with technology first-adopters in and out of      government, and establish interactive feedback systems for      technology development and deployment to ensure sustained      interaction between front-line researchers and with users.       To support the Directorate and its functions, an      interagency Science and Technology Council, which is the      successor to the Science and Technology Steering Council      contained in the original version of the legislation, will      advise the Under Secretary on priorities and strategies for      homeland security R This Council will consist of senior      R officials from across the government and will serve to      facilitate interagency coordination on R activities      pertinent to homeland security. One of the chief      responsibilities of the Council will be to assist the Under      Secretary in developing overarching technology roadmap that      will enable a coherent national homeland security R program      to be coordinated among the many federal agencies.       The Administration's proposal contemplated the designation      of one of the DOE national laboratories to serve as the      primary research and development center for the Department.      However, in recognition of the extensive scope and nature of      homeland security R, as well as the different research and      technology-related capabilities possessed by each of the DOE      laboratories and sites, the GAC-endorsed legislation      establishes in the Directorate an Office for National      Laboratories to coordinate and utilize such entities in      creating a networked laboratory system to support the      missions of the Department. Through joint sponsorship      agreements with the DOE, the legislation allows the      Department to easily access and benefit from the combined      expertise of all of the DOE laboratories and sites.       The Department will have extraordinary analytical needs      cutting across of all of its Directorates, especially with      regard to the assessment, analysis, and management of      threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. Although the      Administration's bill did not specifically address this need,      the President's Strategic Plan released in mid-July suggests      that risk analysis is a fundamental issue that needs to be      addressed in planning for our nation's security. Although the      legislation vests ultimate responsibility for risk analysis      and risk management by the Department with the Secretary, all      the Directorates will be required to assist the Secretary in      coordination with each other and consistent with their own      missions. The Directorate of Science and Technology has a      contributing role to play in this framework by providing the      Secretary and the other Directorates with scientific and      technical support for such functions. To ensure that the      Directorate has access to the requisite resources and      expertise to fulfill its risk analysis responsibilities and      other research-related functions, the legislation gives the      Department the power to contract with or establish FFRDCs-     independent, non-profit institutions that conduct analysis      and provide support integral to the mission and operation of      the sponsoring agency. Thirty-six FFRDCs across the nation      have proven indispensable in enabling the government to      undertake research with a creativity and flexibility not      always available within the confines of a federal agency.      The importance of FFRDCs is underscored by a prominent      study on homeland security conducted by the National      Academy of Sciences, which recommended the establishment      of an FFRDC to furnish capabilities related to risk      analysis, scenario-based threat assessments, red teaming,      and other functions. Moreover, an Office of Risk Analysis      and Assessment is created within the Directorate to ensure      that these functions are given institutional priority and      carried out--whether internally or through outsourcing to      FFRDCs--in a coordinated manner in accordance with the      Secretary's requirements and overall management. This      Office will assume operational responsibility within the      Directorate and on behalf of the Under Secretary for      supporting the risk analysis and risk management needs of      the Secretary and the other Directorates, as well as help      ensure that R activities are aligned with risks and      threats.       The President's proposal included language that would grant      the Department control over funds appropriated to the      National Institute of Health (NIH) for bioterrorism research.      Although the provision clearly contemplated that these funds      would remain committed to the NIH for application in      accordance with the Department's guidelines, the Committee      was concerned that the provision technically allowed for such      funds to be transferred to other agencies, thereby depriving      the NIH of funding necessary to conduct its critical research      in this area. With the collaboration of staff from the      Administration and Senator Thompson's office, a final      provision was negotiated under which NIH funds would not be      transferred out of the HHS. Instead, through joint strategic      agreements, the Secretary of the Department would set general      research priorities for the funds, while the HHS would      establish the specific scientific research agenda as well as      award and manage all grants. This modified language will      protect our strategic commitment to biodefense research,      while leaving the means and methods for this research to the      scientists at the NIH.       The President's proposal targeted a number of R entities      and programs in other agencies for transfer into the      Department. While the Committee does not agree with all of      the Administration's transfers, it recognizes the value of      providing the Department with a critical base of in-house R      capabilities. Therefore, most of the programs targeted by the      Administration have been moved, including the chemical,      biological, and nuclear threat assessment and detection      programs within the Department of Energy (DOE) relevant to      homeland security, and the National Bio-Weapons Defense      Analysis Center to be created within the Department of      Defense. The transferred programs will be collectively      supervised by a new Office of Laboratory Research. Together,      these transferred entities will confer a basic in-house      research capability with the resident scientific expertise to      help the Directorate better coordinate the broader      government-wide homeland R portfolio.       Given that the Federal government represents only one of      several sectors in our nation with R resources and      expertise, the Department will require mechanisms to engage      and benefit from private sector and academic efforts      regarding homeland security. Toward this end, the legislation      allows for the establishment of an Advisory Panel consisting      of experts from the private sector,      academia, State, and local entities to advise and support the      Under Secretary and the Science and Technology Council. The      Panel will ensure that a diversity of perspectives are taken      into consideration in the establishment of priorities, and      that the contributions to be made from the private sector are      properly addressed and incorporated into the national      homeland security effort.       The Directorate will also include an Office for Technology      Evaluation and Transition, which will serve as a      clearinghouse and national point-of-contact for companies and      other entities that possess technologies relevant to homeland      security. The Office will evaluate these technologies and, if      appropriate, assist in developing and transitioning them into      Department entities or other agencies possessing matching      needs. The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) provides an      applicable model for this function, and the legislation      requires the Office to coordinate with or work through TSWG,      or use TSWG as a model, in performing this technology      solicitation and transition role. It is also intended that      this Office serve as the Department's internal center for      testing and evaluating new technologies being considered for      acquisition or deployment by the Department or its entities.      The new Department will be a large one, and very dependent on      technology in carrying out its homeland mission. As a result,      it is vital that new technologies deployed in the      Department's component Directorates and other entities be      compatible and interoperable to ensure efficiency and      expanded capability. The Office, by performing the      Department's testing and evaluation function, will support      the Under Secretary in carrying out his duties as the      Department's chief technology officer. In addition to      conducting testing and evaluation activities for the      Department, the Office will also coordinate with the      Department's Chief Information Officer and with other      agencies in promoting government-wide compatibility and      interoperability with regard to homeland security      technologies and systems.       Rapidly developing medicines and antidotes to counter      chemical and biological weapons is an enormous challenge and      one that government-supported R cannot accomplish on its      own. The legislation directs the Secretary to implement a      strategy to engage the biotechnology and pharmaceutical      industries in the critical research and product development      that will produce antidotes and vaccines to the chemical and      biological weapons that terrorists may employ against our      nation. This strategy should explore and suggest ways to      provide incentives and facilitate ``bench-to-bedside''      transition for these products.       Recognizing that technological prowess in this country is      in communities, as well as colleges and companies, the      Department must tap the boundless expertise and energy of      ordinary citizens. Drawing on legislation developed in the      Senate Commerce Committee, the legislation endorsed by the      Committee creates a National Emergency Technology Guard of      volunteers with expertise in science and technology to assist      local communities in responding to and recovering from      emergencies requiring scientific or technical expertise.       As reported on May 22, S. 2452 included a Directorate of      Emergency Preparedness and Response, with FEMA as its core.      The new GAC-endorsed legislation retains this directorate and      expands it to include some of the programs the Administration      proposed moving to the new department. This amendment also      provides that the President may appoint the same person to      serve as both the Director of FEMA and the Under Secretary      for this directorate.       This directorate's responsibilities include organizing and      training local entities to respond to emergencies and      providing State and local authorities with equipment for      detection, protection, and decontamination in an emergency      involving weapons of mass destruction; overseeing      Federal, State, and local emergency preparedness training      and exercise programs; assembling a single Federal      disaster plan to help orchestrate Federal assistance for      any emergency; coordinating among private sector entities,      including the health community, in emergency planning and      response activities; and developing a comprehensive plan      to address the interface of medical informatics and the      medical response to terrorism. (Medical informatics is the      scientific field that addresses the storage, retrieval,      sharing, and optimal use of biomedical information, data,      and knowledge for problem-solving and decision-making.)      This directorate also creates a National Crisis Action      Center to coordinate federal support for State and local      governments and the private sector during a crisis;      additionally, the directorate is responsible for ensuring      the appropriate integration of operational activities of      the Department of Defense, the National Guard, and other      federal agencies in the Federal Response Plan in order to      respond to acts of terrorism and other disasters.       In addition to FEMA, the Emergency Preparedness and      Response directorate transfers the National Office of      Domestic Preparedness, within the FBI. This entity was      created by the Attorney General in 1998 and coordinates      federal efforts to assist state and local emergency      responders with training and materials necessary to respond      to an event involving weapons of mass destruction. The Office      of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) within the Department of      Justice is also transferred. ODP was developed to help train      State and local law enforcement agencies to respond to      terrorist incidents.       The Administration proposed transferring the Select Agent      Registration Enforcement Program from the Centers for Disease      Control within the Department of Health and Human Services,      to the Department. The Select Agent Registration Enforcement      Program was developed to identify all biological agents and      toxins that may threaten public health and safety, regulate      the transfer of such agents and toxins, and establish a      registration scheme regulating their possession, use, and      transfer. The GAC-endorsed legislation transfers this program      to the Emergency Preparedness and Response directorate      because it is a program critical to preparing for and      responding to a public health emergency. The Under Secretary      for Science and Technology, the Secretary of Agriculture, and      the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention will work together to establish and update the      list of toxins to be monitored.       Like the Administration's proposal, the GAC-endorsed      legislation transfers the Strategic National Stockpile to the      new department. The Strategic National Stockpile is a      stockpile of drugs and vaccines that may be used in the event      of a terrorist attack or other emergencies. However, because      of CDC's experience and expertise, the legislation allows for      the Stockpile to be managed on a day-to-day basis for the      Department by CDC through a new Bioterrorism Preparedness and      Response Division, which is created in this legislation      pursuant to an amendment from Senator Cleland. However, the      Department would remain in charge of the overall strategic      planning concerning the Stockpile. The Public Health      Emergency and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of      2002 authorized funds for both the Stockpile and the      acquisition of smallpox vaccine doses and potassium iodide.      Consequently, the GAC-endorsed legislation transfers      responsibility for the acquisition of smallpox doses and      potassium iodide to this directorate as well.       Finally, the Administration also proposed transferring the      Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health      Preparedness (OPHP) from the Department of Health and Human      Services to the Emergency Preparedness and Response      directorate. This office has three primary components: (1)      the awarding and administration of state and local grants for      public health preparedness; (2) the Principal Science      Advisor, who advises the Secretary on the global R strategy      for HHS; and, (3) the Office of Emergency Preparedness, which      manages rapid-response emergency health and first-responder      personnel. From this Office of the Assistant Secretary for      Public Health Preparedness, the GAC-endorsed legislation      transfers the Office of Emergency Preparedness.       The other two components of the OPHP each play a role in      emergency response, but also a very extensive role in general      public health. Because they perform a dual-use function, and      because of their extensive interaction with other parts of      HHS, it does not seem appropriate to transfer them to the new      department. Additionally, experts in the public health and      biomedical communities expressed concern that the      Administration's proposal would not operate effectively. The      OPHP was established to address the problems of intra-agency      communication and coordination, and it could reverse the      gains achieved by this office to remove it from the      department with which it is primarily engaged. Indeed, HHS      would be probably be forced to re-create this capacity      internally if OPHP were transferred to the Department.       At the same time, it is important the Department have in-     house capability to address biological, chemical, and nuclear      weapons. Consequently, the Department would include those      public health and biomedical programs--the OEP, the Select      Agent Registration Enforcement Programs, and the Strategic      National Stockpile--which focus primarily on terrorism and      emergency response.",

        "statement": "Let me describe what the information sharing title does      specifically.       First, title VII explicitly authorizes companies to search      for cybersecurity threats on their own networks and to take      appropriate actions to defend their networks against these      threats.       Many companies monitor and defend their own networks today,      in order to protect themselves and their customers.       But we have heard from numerous companies that the law in      this area is unclear, and that sometimes it is less risky,      from a liability perspective, to just hope attacks don't      happen than to take additional steps to defend themselves.       So this bill will make the law crystal clear by giving      companies explicit authority to monitor and defend their own      networks.       Second, the bill clearly authorizes private companies to      share cyber threat information with each other.       There have been concerns that antitrust laws or other      statutes prevent companies from cooperating on cyber defense.      This bill, section 702, clearly says: ``notwithstanding any      other provision of law, any private entity may disclose      lawfully obtained cybersecurity threat indicators to any      other private entity in accordance with this section.''       Third, the bill authorizes the government--which will      largely mean, in practice, the intelligence community--to      share classified information about cyber threats with      appropriately cleared organizations, such as companies,      outside of the government.       Today, only government employees and contractors are      eligible to receive security clearances and therefore gain      access to national secrets. To put it another way, those with      a valid ``need to know'' national security secrets are      usually within the government or working for the government.       That isn't true for cyber security. The companies that      underpin our Nation's economy and way of life have a ``need      to know'' about the nature of cyber attacks so they can      better secure their systems.       So under this bill, companies able to qualify to receive      classified information will be certified and then be able to      obtain classified information about what cyber threats to      look out for.       Fourth, the bill establishes a system for any private      sector entity--whether a power utility, a defense contractor,      a telecom company, or others--to share cyber threat      information with the government.       This is the piece that General Alexander--the Director of      the National Security Agency and the Commander of U.S. Cyber      Command--says is absolutely necessary for the protection of      the United States.       Here is how the provision works:       The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with      the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the      Director of National Intelligence, would designate a federal      cybersecurity exchange. This would be an office or center      that already exists, and already shares and receives cyber      threat information.       Private companies would share cyber threat information with      the exchange directly. The exchange must be a civilian      entity; I expect it would be within the Department of      Homeland Security.       Let me stop there. Why not have this portal or exchange be      in the military or the NSA? There are two reasons:        First, we are talking here about the protection of the      government's network--the dot.gov network--and the computer      systems outside of the government. We are not talking about      protecting the dot.mil network and the Department of Defense,      and we are not talking about actions that the military takes      overseas. Protection of the private sector--of the electrical      grid or Wall Street--is simply not the military's or NSA's      responsibility.       Second, there is, for good reason, major concern among      privacy advocates not to have private sector information,      which could include Americans' banking records, or email      traffic, or health care records, being shared by companies      with the military or intelligence community.       In drafting this bill, we heard from several Senators for      whom having a military exchange was a complete non-starter.      We worked with Senators Durbin, Franken, Coons, Akaka,      Blumenthal, and Sanders, and others to craft this language      putting a civilian entity in the lead.       General Keith Alexander, the Director of the National      Security Agency, also supports this model. He wrote, in his      July 31 letter to Senator Reid: ``The American people must      have confidence that threat information is being shared      appropriately and in the most transparent way possible.      That is why I support information to be shared through a      civilian entity, with real-time, rule-based sharing of      cyber security threat indicators with all relevant Federal      partners.'' General Alexander is the top military and      intelligence official on cyber saying that he supports a      civilian exchange.       So we have the Federal exchange. Companies will use the      exchange, as a portal and information will be sent      automatically and instantaneously to other parts of the      government. This is what General Alexander was describing.       This part is critical. We are not talking about information      going to an office in the Department of Homeland Security and      waiting for someone to look at it and figure out whether to      share it and with whom.       This is an automatic, instantaneous process. Information      comes in and is automatically shared with other departments      and agencies.       The bill requires that procedures be put in place so that      information is shared in real-time. This has to be done      automatically, so that cyber defense systems can move to      identify and disrupt a cyber attack as it is coming over the      networks.       I discussed this recently with a CEO of a high-tech      company. He was concerned that information wouldn't reach the      Department of Defense. I explained that our bill would      provide instantaneous sharing to DOD. He said that would      satisfy his concerns. So this is a major point.       Having a single focal point is also more efficient for the      government. It will help eliminate stovepipes because right      now there are dozens of different parts of the government      receiving information from the private sector about the cyber      threats they are encountering, and no one agency has the      responsibility to ensure the information is shared with other      parts of the government.       It would also make privacy and civil liberties oversight      easier, as I will describe in a moment. Finally, it should      save tax payers money, because it is more efficient to manage      and oversee the operation of one designated cybersecurity      exchange versus a half dozen or more parts of the government.       Now let me describe the liability protections, because that      is a critical part of title VII.       Section 706 of the bill provides liability protection for      the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information with the      federal cybersecurity exchange.       The bill reads: ``no civil or criminal cause of action      shall lie or be maintained in any Federal or State court      against any entity [meaning a company] acting as authorized      by this title, and any such action shall be dismissed      promptly for . . . the voluntary disclosure of a lawfully      obtained cybersecurity threat indicator to a cybersecurity      exchange.''       In other words, a company is immune from lawsuit if it      shares cyber threat information with a Federal exchange.       The same immunity applies to:       Companies who monitor their own networks;       Cybersecurity companies who share threat information with      their customers;       Companies that share information with a critical      infrastructure owner or operator; or       Companies who share threat information with other      companies, as long as they also share that information with      the Federal cybersecurity exchange within a reasonable time.       If a company shared information in a way other than the      five ways I just mentioned, it still receives a legal defense      under this bill from suit if the company can make a      reasonable good faith showing that the information sharing      provisions permitted that sharing.       Further, no civil or criminal cause of action can be      brought against a company or an officer, employee, or agency      of a company for the reasonable failure to act on information      received through the information sharing mechanisms set up by      this bill.       Basically, the only way that anyone participating in the      information sharing system can be held liable is if they are      found to have knowingly violated a provision of the bill or      acted in gross negligence.       So there are very strong liability protections in this bill      for anyone that shares information about cyber threats--which      is completely voluntarily.       In addition to narrowly defining what information can be      shared with an exchange, our bill also requires the Federal      government to adopt a very robust privacy and civil liberties      oversight regime for information shared under this title.      There are multiple layers of oversight from different parts      of the executive branch, including the Department of Justice      and the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight      Board, as well as the Congress.       Consider this: In October, General Alexander--the Director      of the NSA--and Anthony Romero, the Executive Director of the      ACLU, spoke together on a cybersecurity roundtable at the      Woodrow Wilson Center. General Alexander praised title VII's      approach to information sharing, and Mr. Romero said ``I      think it strikes the right balance.'' It is not often that      the Director of the NSA and the Executive Director of the      ACLU agree on legislation. If they can, I would hope that the      Senate can come together as well.       The time to act is now. The cyber threat we face is real,      it is serious, and it is growing. The country is vulnerable,      and this legislation is essential. I urge my colleagues to      support the motion to proceed and to support the bill.",

He has a profound, intuitive, knowledge-based understanding of what is under the rocks and what is plainly in sight, what is plainly good or wrong about the intelligence profession. He has led the National Security Agency for the last 6 years. It is an interesting fact that in the National Security Agency, under their roof, is the largest collection of mathematicians in this world. That may be known or not; I suspect it is.

They can also share with the government, and the government, particularly through the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency, can help the private sector strengthen itself. Those kinds of communications, which are critical and would seem natural, don't happen now in too many cases because the private sector is anxious about liability that it might incur. Even the public sector is limited in how much it can reach out or help. So it is important that the House has addressed that part of it.",

        "statement": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true American Hero, a man whose focus, drive, intellect and leadership were responsible for spawning innovative systems that have saved lives and ensured the security of our great nation.   Pedro Luis Rustan, known as ``Pete'' to all within the Intelligence Community, was an extraordinary American. His passing leaves a void within the Intelligence Community and for all his family and friends.   Pete may not have appreciated my remarks because he was never concerned about who received the credit, only that the job was done. However, he was a man who was grateful for the gifts that God gave him and he could think of no greater use for these gifts than service of the Nation that had blessed him and his family with freedom.   Pete was born in 1946 in a small city 40 miles from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay. In August 1967, he made a dramatic escape from Communist Cuba with his father, two sisters, and brother-in-law. They fled to a railway, climbed inside a railroad boxcar and jumped from the moving train as it approached the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo. Pete and his family swam and waded through a snake-infested swamp before reaching multiple tall security fences topped with barbed wire. Pete carried his younger sister on his back over the fences. After being picked up by a Navy patrol craft they sought and received political asylum.   In the early 1970s Pete studied electrical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and was quickly drafted into the Air Force. In the Air Force he served first as an enlisted man, and then successfully completed Officer Candidate School, becoming a U.S. Air Force officer. He eventually went on to graduate school at the University of Florida, from which he received a doctorate in electrical engineering in 1979.   During his 26-year career with the U.S. Air Force, Pete ran several advanced technology space programs and was mission manager for a joint NASA--Defense Department project, the Clementine mission, a small, low-cost spacecraft that made history by mapping the surface of the Moon and discovering ice at its south pole. Daniel Golden, a former NASA director, said that Pete always ``seemed to take on things that were impossible.'' He retired from the Air Force in 1997 with the rank of colonel but continued to deliver intelligence systems that accomplished the seemingly impossible with National Security technical systems.   After retiring from the Air Force, Pete consulted on commercial space ventures and for federal intelligence agencies. He was on an advisory board that recommended changes at the National Security Agency, one of the country's largest intelligence agencies. As Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the National Security Agency said of Pete, ''He was hands-down the most valuable member of that board. He was creative. He was energetic. He was candid without ever being caustic or unkind.''   After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Pete returned to the government, leading research efforts in satellite reconnaissance for the Defense and Intelligence Communities. He held numerous positions at the National Reconnaissance Organization, NRO, including Director of the Advanced Systems and Technology Directorate, Director of the Ground Enterprise Directorate, Director of Small Satellite Development and most recently, Director of the NRO's Mission Support Directorate. He retired from the NRO officially in October 2011. In each instance he enhanced the capability of the organization and demonstrated his well earned reputation as a technical innovator and advocate of streamlined acquisition principles in space programs. He was a true asset to the NRO and to our country.   Pete contributed to improving the world outside of work as well. He personally led missions to a small impoverished town in Honduras where he provided shoes, developed aqueducts and tilapia fish farms. In his private and personal life he also was one who accomplished the seemingly impossible.   On June 28, Pedro ``Pete'' Rustan lost his battle with cancer but won his eternal reward after 65 vibrant years, passing away at his home in Woodbridge, Virginia. He is survived by his wife, Alexandra, and children, Peter and Amy. He leaves behind a legacy of intelligence systems and people whom he mentored to continue to achieve the seemingly impossible in his memory. He will be greatly missed in the Intelligence Community and by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.",

        "statement": "Dear Congressional Leaders: We are writing to express      concern about section 11 of the Stop Trading in Congressional      Knowledge Act (the STOCK Act), which requires that the      financial disclosure forms of senior executive branch      officials be posted on the Internet by August 31. While we      agree that the government should have access to the financial      information of its senior officials to ensure the integrity      of government decision making, we strongly urge that Congress      immediately pass legislation allowing an exception from the      Internet posting requirement for certain executive branch      officials, in order to protect the national security and the      personal safety of these officials and their families.       The STOCK Act was intended to stop insider trading by      Members of Congress. However, section 11 of the Act, which      was added without any public hearings or consideration of      national security or personnel safety implications, requires      that financial data of over 28,000 executive branch officials      throughout the U.S. government, including members of the U.S.      military and career diplomats, law enforcement officials, and      officials in sensitive national security jobs in the Defense      Department, State Department and other agencies, be posted on      their agency websites.       It is not clear what public purpose is served by inclusion      of Section 11. We are not aware that any transparency      concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the existing      review process for executive branch officials, most of whom      have devoted their careers to public service. For several      decades, executive branch officials have prepared and      submitted SF-278 financial disclosure forms to their      employing agencies. The completed forms and the extensive      financial data they contain are carefully reviewed by agency      ethics officers in light of the specific responsibilities of      the officials submitting them in order to identify and      eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Although the forms      may be requested by members of the public, they are not      published in hard-copy or on the Internet. Moreover,      individuals requesting copies of the forms must provide their      names, occupation, and contact information. Agencies      generally notify the filing officials about who has requested      their personal financial information.       In contrast, Section 11 of the STOCK Act would require that      the financial disclosure forms of executive branch officials      be posted on each agency's website and that a government-wide      database be created containing the SF-278s that would be      searchable and sortable without the use of a login or any      other screening process to control or monitor access to this      personal information.       We believe that this new uncontrolled disclosure scheme for      executive branch officials will create significant threats to      the national security and to the personal safety and      financial security of executive branch officials and their      families, especially career employees. Placing complete      personal financial information of all senior officials on the      Internet would be a jackpot for enemies of the United States      intent on finding security vulnerabilities they can exploit.      SF-278 forms include a treasure trove of personal financial      information: the location and value of employees' savings and      checking accounts and certificates of deposit; a full      valuation and listing of their investment portfolio; a      listing of real estate assets and their value; a listing of      debts, debt amounts, and creditors; and the signatures of the      filers. SF-278s include financial information not only about      the filing employee, but also about the employee's spouse and      dependent children.       Posting this detailed financial information on the Internet      will jeopardize the safety of executive branch officials--     including military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and      potentially intelligence officials--and their families who      are posted or travel in dangerous areas, especially in      certain countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Embassy      and military security officers already advise these officials      to post no personal identifying information on the Internet.      Publishing the financial assets of these officials will allow      foreign governments, and terrorist or criminal groups to      specifically target these officials or their families for      kidnapping, harassment, manipulation of financial assets, and      other abuse.       Equally important, the detailed personal financial      information--particularly detailed information about debts      and creditors--contained in the SF-278s of senior officials      is precisely the information that foreign intelligence      services and other adversaries spend billions of dollars      every year to uncover as they look for information that can      be used to harass, intimidate and blackmail those in the      government with access to classified information. Yet under      the STOCK Act, these SF-278s will be placed on the Internet      for any foreign government or group to access without      disclosing their identity or purpose and with no notice to      the employees or their agencies. We should not hand on a      silver platter to foreign intelligence services information      that could be used to compromise or harass career public      servants who have access to the most sensitive information      held by the U.S. government.       Section 11 could also jeopardize the safety and security of      other executive branch officials, such as federal prosecutors      and others who are tracking down and bringing to justice      domestic organized crime gangs and foreign terrorists. Crime      gangs could easily target the families of prosecutors with      substantial assets or debts for physical attacks or threats.       Finally, publishing detailed banking and brokerage      information of executive branch officials, especially with      their signatures, is likely to invite hacking, financial      attacks, and identity theft of these officials and their      families, particularly by groups or individuals who may be      affected by their governmental work.       Given these inevitable adverse national security      consequences, we urge you to amend the STOCK Act to protect      U.S. national security interests and the safety of executive      branch officials by creating an exception from the      requirements of Section 11 for senior executive branch      officials with security clearances. The exception should also      apply to other officials based on a determination by an      agency head that an exception is necessary to protect the      safety of the official or the official's family. At the very      minimum, Congress should act to delay implementation of      Section 11 until the national security and personal safety      implications can be fully evaluated.       If the financial disclosure forms of senior executive      officials are actually posted on the Internet in August,      there will be irreparable damage to U.S. national security      interests, and many senior executives and their families may      be placed in danger. This issue is too important to be      trapped in partisan politics. We urge Congress to act      swiftly, before the Congress goes on its summer recess on      August 6.

The field of cyber security is projected to grow by 41 percent over the next 8 years, and jobs in this expanding field pay a median hourly wage of $38 per hour. Maryland is a hotbed of activity in the cyber security field since it is home to the U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Defense Information Systems Agency, the Navy Fleet Cyber Command, and hundreds of Federal contractors and private technology companies. In an effort to address the lack skilled cyber security workers and increase the number of qualified workers in the pipeline, a three-way partnership--the Pathways to Cybersecurity Careers Consortium--was created to bring together the efforts of six workforce development agencies, three community colleges, and the local business community. The partnership, led by Anne Arundel Workforce Development Corporation, was awarded a $4.9 million community-based job training grant to create the Pathways to Cyber Security Program. The grant was intended to assist 1,000 new, dislocated, underemployed, recently separated veterans, and incumbent workers in obtaining cyber security certifications identified as critical industry shortages by regional businesses and government agencies. I am proud to report that nearly 1,150 workers have received training in the program, 755 program participants have received cyber security certifications, and 721 program graduates have been hired by an employer or improved their skills with an existing employer. Some of the graduates of the cyber security programs have begun to work with a number of Federal agencies in my home State.",

Such corrective action shall      include reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable      costs incurred, and may include back pay and related      benefits, travel expenses, and compensatory damages not to      exceed $300,000. The Board may recommend, but may not order,      reinstatement or hiring of a former employee. The Board may      order that the former employee be treated as though the      employee were transferring from the most recent position held      when seeking other positions within the executive branch.

        "statement": "One of the most excruciating images of the September 11      attacks is the sight of a man who was trapped in one of the      World Trade Center towers. Stripped of his suit jacket and      tie and hanging on to what appears to be his office curtains,      he is seen trying to lower himself outside a window to the      floor immediately below. Frantically kicking his legs in an      effort to find a purchase, he loses his grip, and falls.       That horrific scene and thousands more were the images that      awakened a sleeping nation on that long, brutal morning.      Instead of overwhelming fear or paralyzing self-doubt, the      attacks were met with defiance, unity and a sense of moral      purpose. Following the heroic example of ordinary citizens      who put their fellow human beings and the public good ahead      of themselves, the country's leaders cast aside politics and      personal ambition and enacted the USA Patriot Act just 45      days later.       A mere four-and-a-half years after victims were forced to      choose between being burned alive and jumping from 90      stories, it is frankly shocking that there is anyone in      Washington who would politicize the Patriot Act. It is an      insult to those who died to tell the American people that the      organization posing the greatest threat to their liberty is      not al Qaeda but the FBI. Hearing any member of Congress      actually crow about ``killing'' or ``playing chicken'' with      this critical legislation is as disturbing today as it would      have been when Ground Zero was still smoldering. Today we      know in far greater detail what not having it cost us.       Critics contend that the Patriot Act was rushed into law in      a moment of panic. The truth is, the policies and guidelines      it corrected had a long, troubled history and everybody who      had to deal with them knew it. The ``wall'' was a tortuous      set of rules promulgated by Justice Department lawyers in      1995 and imagined into law by the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act (FISA) court.       Conceived as an added protection for civil liberties      provisions already built into the statute, it was the wall      and its real-world ramifications that hardened the failure-     to-share culture between agencies, allowing early information      about 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi to      fall through the cracks. More perversely, even after the      significance of these terrorists and their presence in the      country was known by the FBI's intelligence division, the      wall prevented it from talking to its own criminal division      in order to hunt them down.       Furthermore, it was the impenetrable FISA guidelines and      fear of provoking the FISA court's wrath if they were      transgressed that discouraged risk-averse FBI supervisors      from applying for a FISA search warrant in the Zacarias      Moussaoui case. The search, finally conducted on the      afternoon of 9/11, produced names and phone numbers of people      in the thick of the 9/11 plot, so many fertile clues that      investigators believe that at least one airplane, if not      all four, could have been saved.       In 2002, FISA's appellate level Court of Review examined      the entire statutory scheme for issuing warrants in national      security investigations and declared the ``wall'' a      nonsensical piece of legal overkill, based neither on express      statutory language nor reasonable interpretation of the FISA      statute. The lower court's attempt to micromanage the      execution of national security warrants was deemed an      assertion of authority which neither Congress or the      Constitution granted it. In other words, those lawyers and      judges who created, implemented and so assiduously enforced      the FISA guidelines were wrong and the American people paid      dearly for it.       Despite this history, some members of Congress contend that      this process-heavy court is agile enough to rule on quickly      needed National Security Agency (NSA) electronic surveillance      warrants. This is a dubious claim. Getting a FISA warrant      requires a multistep review involving several lawyers at      different offices within the Department of Justice. It can      take days, weeks, even months if there is a legal dispute      between the principals. ``Emergency'' 72-hour intercepts      require sign-offs by NSA lawyers and pre-approval by the      attorney general before surveillance can be initiated.      Clearly, this is not conducive to what Gen. Michael Hayden,      principal deputy director of national intelligence, calls      ``hot pursuit'' of al Qaeda conversations.       The Senate will soon convene hearings on renewal of the      Patriot Act and the NSA terrorist surveillance program. A      minority of senators want to gamble with American lives and      ``fix'' national security laws, which they can't show are      broken. They seek to eliminate or weaken anti-terrorism      measures which take into account that the Cold War and its      slow-moving, analog world of landlines and stationary targets      is gone. The threat we face today is a completely new      paradigm of global terrorist networks operating in a high-     velocity digital age using the Web and fiber-optic      technology. After four-and-a-half years without another      terrorist attack, these senators think we're safe enough to      cave in to the same civil liberties lobby that supported that      deadly FISA wall in the first place. What if they, like those      lawyers and judges, are simply wrong?       Meanwhile, the media, mouthing phrases like ``Article II      authority,'' ``separation of powers'' and ``right to      privacy,'' are presenting the issues as if politics have      nothing to do with what is driving the subject matter and its      coverage. They want us to forget four years of relentless      ``connect-the-dots'' reporting about the missed chances that      ``could have prevented 9/11.'' They have discounted the      relevance of references to the two 9/11 hijackers who lived      in San Diego. But not too long ago, the media itself reported      that phone records revealed that five or six of the hijackers      made extensive calls overseas.       NBC News aired an ``exclusive'' story in 2004 that      dramatically recounted how al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, the San      Diego terrorists who would later hijack American Airlines      flight 77 and fly it into the Pentagon, received more than a      dozen calls from an al Qaeda ``switchboard'' inside Yemen      where al-Mihdhar's brother-in-law lived. The house received      calls from Osama Bin Laden and relayed them to operatives      around the world. Senior correspondent Lisa Myers told the      shocking story of how, ``The NSA had the actual phone number      in the United States that the switchboard was calling, but      didn't deploy that equipment, fearing it would be accused of      domestic spying.'' Back then, the NBC script didn't describe      it as ``spying on Americans.'' Instead, it was called one of      the ``missed opportunities that could have saved 3,000      lives.''       Another example of opportunistic coverage concerns the      Patriot Act's ``library provision.'' News reports have given      plenty of ink and airtime to the ACLU's unsupported claims      that the government has abused this important records      provision. But how many Americans know that several of the      hijackers repeatedly accessed computers at public      libraries in New Jersey and Florida, using personal Internet      accounts to carry out the conspiracy? Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi      logged on four times at a college library in New Jersey      where they purchased airline tickets for AA 77 and later      confirmed their reservations on Aug. 30. In light of this,      it is ridiculous to suggest that the Justice Department      has the time, resources or interest in ``investigating the      reading habits of law abiding citizens.''       We now have the ability to put remote control cameras on      the surface of Mars. Why should we allow enemies to      annihilate us simply because we lack the clarity or resolve      to strike a reasonable balance between a healthy skepticism      of government power and the need to take proactive measures      to protect ourselves from such threats? The mantra of civil-     liberties hard-liners is to ``question authority''--even when      it is coming to our rescue--then blame that same authority      when, hamstrung by civil liberties laws, it fails to save us.      The old laws that would prevent FBI agents from stopping the      next al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were built on the bedrock of a      35-year history of dark, defeating mistrust. More Americans      should not die because the peace-at-any-cost fringe and      antigovernment paranoids still fighting the ghost of Nixon      hate George Bush more than they fear al Qaeda. Ask the      American people what they want. They will say that they want      the commander in chief to use all reasonable means to catch      the people who are trying to rain terror on our cities. Those      who cite the soaring principle of individual liberty do not      appear to appreciate that our enemies are not seeking to      destroy individuals, but whole populations.       Three weeks before 9/11, an FBI agent with the bin Laden      case squad in New York learned that al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi      were in this country. He pleaded with the national security      gatekeepers in Washington to launch a nationwide manhunt and      was summarily told to stand down. When the FISA Court of      Review tore down the wall in 2002, it included in its ruling      the agent's Aug. 29, 2001, email to FBI headquarters:      ``Whatever has happened to this--someday someone will die--     and wall or not--the public will not understand why we were      not more effective and throwing every resource we had at      certain problems. Let's hope the National Security Law Unit      will stand behind their decisions then, especially since the      biggest threat to us now, [bin Laden], is getting the most      `protection.' ''       The public has listened to years of stinging revelations      detailing how the government tied its own--hands in stopping      the devastating attacks of September 11. It is an      irresponsible violation of the public trust for members of      Congress to weaken the Patriot Act or jeopardize the NSA      terrorist surveillance program because of the same illusory      theories that cost us so dearly before, or worse, for rank      partisan advantage. If they do, and our country sustains yet      another catastrophic attack that these antiterrorism tools      could have prevented, the phrase ``connect the dots'' will      resonate again--but this time it will refer to the trail of      innocent American blood which leads directly to the Senate      floor.",

I call my colleagues' attention to an article published in the Washington Post in which it is reported that Joseph Nacchio, the former CEO of Qwest, alleges that his company was denied NSA contracts after he declined in a February 27, 2001 meeting at Fort Meade with National Security Agency, NSA, representatives to give the NSA customer calling records.",

Because most of the provisions      contained in H.R. 6480 are substantively identical to those      in H.R. 6393--save for changes to section numbers--this Joint      Explanatory Statement dispenses with a full section-by-     section analysis and explanation of the text for H.R. 6480.      Instead, the Agreement reiterates, and incorporates herein by      reference, the section-by-section analysis and explanation of      the text for H.R. 6393 found at pages H7041 to H7043 of the      Congressional Record for November 30, 2016, except as      follows:     Provisions of H.R. 6480 not included in H.R. 6393       Section 3. This section provides that this Joint      Explanatory Statement shall have the same effect with respect      to the implementation of this H.R. 6480 as if it were a joint      explanatory statement of a committee of conference.       Section 306. The section directs the Director of National      Intelligence (DNI) to implement a multi-sector workforce      initiative to improve the management of the workforce of the      intelligence community, achieve appropriate ratios of      government and contract workers, and establish processes for      such ratios to be built and maintained. The section provides      that personnel caps for IC components will be eliminated      during a trial period in Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018. Absent      further congressional action, at the start of Fiscal Year      2019, the trial period will sunset and personnel caps will be      restored.       Section 308. This section requires the DNI to issue and      release guidance regarding engagements between the      entertainment industry and the IC.       Section 312. This section directs the Department of      Homeland Security to establish a program to provide      assistance to covered critical infrastructure, in order to      reduce the risk of regional or national catastrophic harm      caused by cyberattacks against such infrastructure.     Provisions of H.R. 6393 not included in H.R. 6480       Section 308. Modification of certain whistleblower      procedures.       Section 421. Clarification of authority, direction, and      control over the information assurance directorate of the      National Security Agency.        Section 601. Information on activities of the Privacy and      Civil Liberties Oversight Board.       Section 602. Authorization of appropriations for Privacy      and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.     Provisions of H.R. 6480 that Differ from H.R. 6393       Section 104. This section has been modified to authorize      for the Intelligence Community Management Account of DNI for      Fiscal Year 2017 the sum $561,788,000 vice $559,796,000, and      add ``Intelligence'' before ``Community Management Account''      and ``made available'' before ``for advance research'' in      paragraph (1) of subsection (c).       Section 304. The title of this section has been modified to      read ``Math'' rather than ``Mathematics.''       Section 305.

        "statement": "Washington.--Today, the Senate Intelligence Committee is      expected to release its report on the prewar intelligence on      Iraq. The document is likely to make clear that America's      intelligence network, particularly the Central Intelligence      Agency, badly needs repair.       The Senate report will also show that America's      intelligence shortcomings aren't going to be addressed simply      by changing C.I.A. directors. As the report should make      clear, our spy services both failed to do a thorough enough      job watching Iraq's weapons programs and played down evidence      that challenged the prevailing assumptions that the programs      were active. In addition, analysts did not critically      evaluate their sources of information; instead, they      marshaled the available evidence to paint the picture that      policymakers wanted to see.       And how will President Bush and his administration respond      to these findings? It's unlikely that they will do much of      anything. After all, every independent panel that examined      American post-cold-war intelligence--including President      Bush's own Scowcroft commission--recognized that fundamental      structural changes were needed in our intelligence services.      Yet, the White House has remained steadfastly passive as      critical problems have gone unaddressed. Meanwhile,      administration loyalists have argued repeatedly that      structural change is not needed to improve the community's      performance, providing a politically comfortable rationale      for the White House's inaction.       In theory, the argument against radical reform might seem      plausible. The director of Central Intelligence today has      sufficient authority on paper to address many of the issues      that will be identified in the Senate report, like the      failure of collectors and analysts to share information about      sources.       But in practice, the C.I.A. has had a hard time breaking      free from its culture of mediocrity. During my years in      government at the C.I.A. and elsewhere, I was repeatedly told      that the problems now publicly identified in the Senate      report were going to be fixed. I remember years of discussion      about the desirability of ``co-locating'' analysts and      operations officers working on the same target--seeing to it      that they had the equal access to information about their      sources. But in the end, nothing was done to change old ways      of doing business, setting the stage for the Iraq fiasco.       The story, it seems, hasn't changed much. In February, for      example, Jami Miscik, the agency's deputy director of      intelligence, told C.I.A. analysts in a speech that the      problems with information-sharing would be fixed within 30      days. It's July, and nothing has happened.       Clearly, structural reform needs to go beyond the creation      of a freestanding intelligence ``czar'' who would oversee the      entire American spy network. We need to develop a model of      ``jointness'' for the intelligence community, analogous to      what the Goldwater-Nichols Act did for the uniformed      military 18 years ago. That legislation made the chairman      of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the principal military      adviser to the president. It also mandated cross-service      commands, defined regionally and functionally, as the      operational chains of command for American military      forces.       This change produced real improvement in military      performance. Before Goldwater-Nichols, too many modern      military missions were characterized by disaster: the botched      attempt to rescue hostages in Iran, the bombing of the Marine      barracks in Lebanon, the operational problems that plagued      the invasion of Grenada.       Since Goldwater-Nichols required the armed services to      collaborate, we have seen the successes of Panama, Operation      Desert Storm and the outstanding battlefield performance of      our forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.       This model should be applied to American intelligence. This      means moving away from the current organizational structure,      defined primarily along disciplinary and agency lines. (The      C.I.A.'s directorate of intelligence, for example, is      responsible for all-source analysis; the directorate of      operations is responsible for human intelligence collection;      the National Security Agency is responsible for      communications intelligence. Turf is sacred.)       Instead, we should organize and deploy our resources      against high-priority targets, including terrorism, weapons      of mass destruction, China and problem states in the Middle      East. Focused on a particular target, each group would draw      on people and resources from across the intelligence      community. These new target-based centers would report to a      new national intelligence director, not to heads of      individual agencies. Existing agencies would function      primarily as providers of personnel and resources, much as      the individual military services function in relation to the      combatant commands.       Certainly, there have been some tentative steps toward      collaboration. The Counterterrorist Center and the Weapons      Intelligence, Proliferation and Arms Control Center, both of      which report to the director of Central Intelligence, reflect      some of the logic of such cooperation. While the      counterterrorist center wasn't inclusive enough to bring      together information that might have stopped the 9/11      attacks, at least its analysts and operators are focused, in      an integrated way, on their target.       Still, it is clear that our intelligence agencies cannot      move toward partnership on their own. The post-9/11 battles      among the counterterrorist center, the new Terrorist Threat      Integration Center, the F.B.I., and the Department of      Homeland Security over primacy in assessing the terrorist      threat strongly suggest that we have regressed in the effort      to integrate. For its part, the arms control center was not      independent enough of C.I.A. views to avoid being led toward      a flawed analysis of the Iraqi arsenal.       It is going to require strong presidential and      Congressional leadership to achieve genuine reform.      Thoughtful members on both sides of the aisle in both houses      of Congress are already working on serious reform proposals,      though nobody has yet had the courage to devise a Goldwater-     Nichols Act for our spy agencies. In this context, the Bush      administration's lack of initiative is inexplicable and      unconscionable.       There are those who argue that intelligence reform should      not be taken up during a political season. They are wrong.      This kind of reform can take place only in a political      moment. We need a thorough discussion of the issue in the      context of the current presidential campaign so that whoever      is inaugurated in January has a mandate to break      organizational pottery in order to save American lives.",

This White Paper lists a number of possible actions the defense and intelligence communities should consider to prevent this serious loss of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and design capability. I have also requested that the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office submit reports and plans of action to respond to this impending national security threat. I have asked that these reports provide an analysis of the semiconductor manufacturing issues that relate to defense and national security, as well as an analysis of the potential solutions that are discussed in the White Paper. I hope these reports will detail the steps that will be taken to counteract this loss of critical components for U.S. defense needs, as well as a timetable for the implementation of such steps.

Whether we are sending a message or simply pointing to our diversity, I submit our official delegation would be enhanced by adding the following: an American citizen of Russian parentage, perhaps a Russian orphan adopted and raised to adulthood by loving parents in the United States would be a good addition to this delegation or a Syrian American who has fled the barbaric and treacherous rule of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. In addition, an Iranian-American exile from the oppressive and murderous regime in Iran might make an outstanding addition to this delegation.

Finally, the bill does nothing to address the surveillance excesses committed by the National Security Agency, which is a combat support agency of DoD. For all of these reasons, I cannot support this bill and call on my colleagues to join me in opposing it.",

        "statement": "So here's the big Republican agenda for the 2006 elections:      Other people's sex lives (a.k.a. gay marriage), flag-burning,      illegal Mexican immigrants, tax cuts and Chicken Little.       There's no surprise about the first few. A GOP campaign      resembles a traveling tent show. White House sideshow barker      Karl Rove expects that the rubes who line up every two years      to see the two-headed calf and the bearded lady will fall for      flag-burning again. Never mind that Republicans have done      nothing about it since President Bush's father visited a flag      factory during his 1988 campaign. Flag burning as a protest      all but disappeared after 9/11. Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y.,      also has joined this crusade, the surest sign that she's      contemplating running for president in 2008.       Amending the Constitution to forbid gay marriage is another      election-year shell game. Finessing it shouldn't be too hard      for      Democrats. If your church refuses to solemnize same-sex      marriages, that's its undeniable First Amendment right.      Forbidding people to enter into domestic partnership      contracts due to sexual orientation, however, would be un-     American.       No, that won't persuade obsessive homophobes, but they're      fewer all the time. Illegal immigration's something else      Republicans have ignored for six years. Ironically, Bush's      stance reflects the ``compassionate conservatism'' he      campaigned on in 2000 but abandoned, maybe because Mexican      immigration is a very old story in Texas that he actually      knows something about.       Ironically, that's got the GOP's Knothead faction all riled      up, helping GOP congressmen in safe districts distance      themselves from an increasingly unpopular White House, but      also hurting Republicans among Hispanic voters in swing      districts.       Ditto tax cuts. Even the most credulous are getting uneasy      with the GOP's ongoing war on arithmetic and worried about      spiraling debt caused by Bush's profligate spending.       Influential conservative author-activist Richard A.      Viguerie recently wrote a Washington Post op-ed predicting      that ``without a drastic change in direction, millions of      conservatives will . . . stay home this November. And maybe      they should. Conservatives are beginning to realize that      nothing will change until there's a change in the GOP      leadership. If congressional Republicans win this fall, they      will see themselves as vindicated, and nothing will get      better.'' Which brings us to the Chicken Little theme on      which Republican hopes appear to hinge. Sen. Elizabeth Dole,      R-N.C,, first raised it in a recent fund-raising letter on      behalf of the party's Senatorial Campaign Committee. If      Democrats regain Congress, see, they'll act the way      Republicans acted toward Bill Clinton, calling for ``endless      investigations, congressional censure and maybe even      impeachment of President Bush.'' And then the terrorists      would win!       Many pundits who helped publicize the 1,000-odd subpoenas      that congressional Republicans dispatched to the Clinton      White House find the prospect of Democrats issuing subpoenas      terribly alarming. Slate's John Dickerson worries that a      Democratic-led House might ``get bogged down with      investigations and embrace the worst Bush-hating tendencies      of its members.'' Time columnist Joe Klein, a.k.a.      ``Anonymous,'' author of the novel'' Primary Colors,'' who's      grown adept at advancing Gap themes while affecting to      deplore them, laments that the likely succession of Rep. John      Conyers, D-Mich., to chair the House Judiciary Committee if      Democrats win in November gives Republicans a chance to play      the race card.       Because Conyers is African American and has sometimes used      the words ``Bush'' and ``impeachable offense'' in the same      sentence, Klein fears that Rove will have a field day      depicting the veteran Detroit congressman as Kenneth Starr in      blackface.       The idea that irrational hatred of Bush motivates most      Democrats is a favorite topic on the talkradio right.      Psychologists call it ``projection,'' attributing to others      motives that mirror your own.       The best way for Democrats to deal with this Chicken Little      theme is straight on, as Conyers has attempted to do. In a      recent Washington Post column, he correctly identified the      ``straw-man'' logical fallacy that underlies it: attacking      arguments your adversary has never actually made.       Years of one-party government, Conyers said, have left      Americans with many unanswered questions, such as ``whether      intelligence was mistaken or manipulated in the run-up to the      Iraq war . . . the extent to which high-ranking officials      approved of the use of torture . . . whether the leaking of      the name of a covert CIA operative was deliberate or      accidental'' and who did it.       Any alert citizen can add particulars: the legality of      National Security Agency's warrantless wiretaps and the      constitutionality of Bush's 740 ``signing statements,'' as      reported by The Boston Globe, in which the president claims      the power to ignore laws with which he disagrees.       Conyers wisely stresses that the GOP-led House impeachment      of Clinton proved ``that partisan vendettas ultimately      provoke a public backlash and are never viewed as      legitimate.'' Nobody wants a government that does nothing but      investigate itself. But the Republican Congress has      completely abdicated its constitutional responsibilities. Our      democracy cannot long survive a president who claims the      prerogatives of a king.       That's an argument the Democrats must win.",

        "statement": "Spring has given way to summer's full-furnace heat in      Washington, apparently taking with it any scintilla of sense      that Congress may yet possess.       In the House, Republicans who could not even raise an      eyebrow at reports that the National Security Agency has been      conducting warrantless wiretaps of Americans became instant      civil libertarians when the FBI conducted a search of a      congressman's office.       The Senate, meanwhile, is scheduled next week to take up      legislation by Arizona Republican Jon Kyl that would      permanently repeal the estate tax on the wealthiest      Americans. If enacted, Kyl's bill would plunge the government      another trillion dollars into the red during the first decade      (2011-2021) that it would be in effect.       Behind the scenes, the action has been on the Democratic      side in the Senate, as the party's leadership has sought to      dissuade Montana's Max Baucus, ranking Democrat on the      Finance Committee, from forging a halfway-house compromise      with Kyl that would deplete revenue by only $500 billion to      $600 billion during that decade. The Republicans would need      Baucus to bring roughly a half-dozen Democrats along with him      to reach the magic number of 60 votes required to overcome      any filibuster that the vast majority of Democrats would      mount to block any such measure.       Even a paltry $500 billion, of course, is a lot of money to      drain from public coffers just when boomers are going onto      Social Security and Medicare and the number of employers      providing health insurance, if present trends continue, might      have dropped to a virtuous handful. To cover those and other      needs, Congress will either plunge us deeper into debt or      increase some other levies--payroll taxes, say--that will      come out of the pockets of the 99 percent of Americans whom      the estate tax doesn't touch.       A decades-long campaign by right-wing activists      (brilliantly documented by Yale professors Michael Graetz and      Ian Shapiro in their book ``Death by a Thousand Cuts'') has      convinced many Americans that the estate tax poses a threat      to countless hardworking families. That was always nonsense,      and under the estate tax revisions that almost all Democrats      support--raising the threshold for eligibility to $3.5      million for an individual and $7 million for a couple--it      becomes more nonsensical still. Under the $3.5 million      exemption, the number of family-owned small businesses      required to pay any taxes in the year 2000 would have been      just 94, according to a study by the Congressional Budget      Office. The number of family farms that would have had to      sell any assets to pay that tax would have been 13.       On the other hand, an estate tax repeal would save the      estate of Vice President Cheney between $13 million and $61      million, according to the publicly available data on his net      worth. It would save the estate of Defense Secretary Donald      Rumsfeld between $32 million and $101 million. The estate of      retired Exxon Mobil chairman Lee Raymond would pocket a cozy      $164 million. As for the late Sam Walton's kids, whose      company already makes taxpayers foot the bill for the      medical expenses of thousands of its employees, the cost      to the government for not taxing their estates would run      into the multiple billions.       The Baucus split-the-difference measure wouldn't repeal the      estate tax, but it would still cut the tax rates on the      estates of the super-rich by 15 percent. The Montana senator      spent much of last week trying to line up a handful of his      Senate Democratic colleagues to support his proposal, in the      hope of being able to announce an unshakable 60 votes      favoring this folly when the debate begins next week.       Why any Democrat would back such a measure, however, is a      deep mystery. From the policy standpoint, it would make it      vastly more difficult both to shore up programs that      Democrats believe need shoring up--better educating the      nation's children, for one--and to get the nation's fiscal      house in order. Politically, backing the measure is even      wackier. The Democrats are running this year as the party of      comparative fiscal sanity and greater economic equity and      security. Baucus's compromise would undermine all those      premises. Republicans might very well attack Democratic      senators up for reelection this year for failing to repeal      this hideous death tax, as they call it, but any Democratic      senator who can't rebut that charge in what is shaping up as      a very Democratic year should probably be in another line of      work.       Last Friday Baucus's staffers assured the Democratic Senate      leadership's staff that their boss would back off his      compromise campaign. Still, given Baucus's penchant for      mischief (it was largely he who rounded up enough Democratic      votes to enact Medicare Part D and its Big Pharma giveaway),      those assurances have met with some skepticism on Capitol      Hill. The Democrats' capacity to undermine themselves has not      vanished with the final days of spring.",

        "statement": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Colonel David ``Dave'' William Reaney upon his retirement as Executive Director of Feeding the Gulf Coast.   Dave was born in Iowa and grew up in California before enlisting in the Army as an intelligence analyst in 1969. After serving in Germany, he commissioned through the Officer Candidate program at Fort Benning in 1974.   He spent the next 26 years as a Military Intelligence Officer at 12 different locations throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. He served as Chief of the Electronic Intelligence Watch, U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany supporting operations following the bombing of the Beirut Marine Barracks, as well as the 1986 U.S. attack on Libya. After being promoted to Colonel in 1996, he was assigned to the National Security Agency as Deputy Chief of the Office of Global Response.   After 30 years of active service, Col. Reaney retired in February 2000. Just a few months later, in April, he was appointed Executive Director of Feeding the Gulf Coast. Formerly known as the Bay Area Food Bank, Feeding the Gulf Coast is responsible for serving a 24-county area including south Alabama, south Mississippi, and the Florida panhandle. The organization operates multiple nutrition programs and distributed over 20 million pounds of food in 2015.   Under his leadership, Feeding the Gulf Coast reached new heights and achieved major milestones. The organization moved into a new facility, increased distribution from 4 to over 21 million pounds of food annually, acquired nine refrigerated delivery vehicles, developed afterschool snack and summer lunch programs for children at over 215 locations, and constructed a new branch warehouse in Milton, Florida. Col. Reaney also oversaw the organization's disaster response to Hurricane Ivan, Hurricane Katrina, and the Gulf Coast oil spill.   Col. Reaney has a long list of personal achievements throughout his years of military and humanitarian service. He is a 1999 inductee into the Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame at Fort Benning, Georgia and a 2001 inductee into the University of South Alabama ROTC Department Hall of Fame. His fifteen military service awards include the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. He has also served on the board of the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, as well as past president of both the Alabama Food Bank Association and the Florida Association of Food Banks. Additionally, he played a critical part in the establishment of Alabama Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey's ``End Child Hunger'' task force.   So on behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, I wish Colonel Dave Reaney and his wife, Monika, all the best upon his retirement. And, on behalf of a grateful nation, I share our appreciation and gratitude for his years of service and sacrifice.",

        "statement": "For those charged with gathering the information our      government needs to keep us safe, the news has been grim.      Following the leaks by Edward Snowden beginning in June last      year of highly classified intelligence gathering techniques,      the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center,      Matthew Olsen, disclosed in September that terrorists tracked      by U.S. intelligence services have started encrypting their      communications in ways that defeat detection, and that the      government has lost track of several.       Meanwhile, Islamic State terrorists continue to rampage      across Syria and Iraq, even as the group, also known as ISIS,      uses sophisticated Internet communications to swell its ranks      with recruits bearing U.S., Canadian or European passports      who can easily slip back into their native countries and      wreak havoc.       In that threat environment, one would think that the last      thing on the ``to do'' list of the 113th Congress would be to      add to the grim news. Yet Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid      has announced that he will bring to the floor the      extravagantly misnamed USA Freedom Act, a major new bill      exquisitely crafted to hobble the gathering of electronic      intelligence.       For starters, the bill ends the National Security Agency's      bulk collection of what is called telephone metadata. This      includes the date, time, duration and telephone numbers for      all calls, but not their content or the identity of the      caller or called, and is information already held by      telephone companies. The bill would substitute a cumbersome      and untried process that would require the NSA, when it seeks      to check on which telephone numbers have called or been      called by a number reasonably associated with terrorist      activity, to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Court, or FISA court, and then scurry to each of      the nation's telephone-service providers to comb through the      information that remains in their hands rather than in the      NSA's.       Nothing in the bill requires the telephone companies to      preserve the metadata for any prescribed period. Current      Federal Communications Commission regulations impose an 18-     month retention requirement, but administrative regulations      are subject to change. It isn't hard to envision companies      that wish to offer subscribers the attraction of rapid      destruction of these records, or a complaisant bureaucracy      that lets them do it.       The bill's imposition of the warrant requirement on the NSA      would be more burdensome than what any assistant U.S.      attorney must do to get metadata in a routine criminal case,      which is simply to aver that the information is needed in      connection with a criminal investigation--period.       Proponents say this change is necessary to allay fears that      the NSA could use telephone metadata to construct an      electronic portrait of an American citizen's communications,      and determine whether that person has, say, consulted a      psychiatrist, or called someone else's spouse. However, only      22 people at the NSA are permitted access to metadata, and      only upon a showing of relevance to a national-security      investigation, and they are barred from any data-mining      whatsoever even in connection with such an investigation.      They are overseen by a Madisonian trifecta of the FISA court,      the executive and committees of Congress. Those people and      everyone else at the NSA live in constant dread of failing to      detect a terrorist attack. Nonetheless, the sponsors of the      USA Freedom Act prefer the counsel of hypothetical fears to      the logic of concrete realities.       This sensitivity to abstract concerns doesn't stop at the      water's edge. Under the bill, if the FISA court directs any      change, however technical, in the gathering of information      from foreigners abroad, no information gathered before the      change is implemented could be used before any official body      in this country--agency, grand jury, court, whatever.       Back in the bad old days, as during World War II and the      Cold War, intelligence of all sorts directed at protecting      national security was gathered by the executive without      supervision by judges who, after all, know nothing about the      subject and cannot be held to account for adverse outcomes.      After the Watergate scandal and the resignation of      President Nixon, the FISA court was established in 1978 to      provide oversight for intelligence gathering, in addition to      that already provided by the executive and by Congress. Now,      there are those who complain that the FISA court accedes too      often to requests for government access to information, and      does not appear to resemble a true court in that there is no      public advocate opposing the government position.       But the nearly uniform success of the government before the      FISA court is due both to the government's careful restraint      in presenting applications, and to pushback from the court      itself--which results in the amendment of applications. Even      when the government applies for wiretaps or search warrants      in ordinary criminal cases there is no advocate opposing the      application.       Nonetheless, this new bill would establish a permanent      advocate appointed by the court to oppose the government's      applications before the FISA court. This provision has      elicited an extraordinary written objection from a former      presiding judge of the FISA court. U.S. District Judge John      D. Bates points out that the presence of such an advocate,      who cannot conceivably be aware of all the facts, would      simply add to the burdens of the court and could wind up      sacrificing both national security and privacy.       This bill redefines the FISA court, which was never meant      to be an adversary tribunal and was imposed simply as an      added safeguard in the 1970s, without regard to its history      or its purpose. Worse, it is a three-headed constitutional      monster: It is a violation of both the separation of powers      principle and the Constitution's appointments clause by      having judges rather than the president appoint the public      advocate, and then it has the advocate litigate against the      Justice Department when both executive offices are supposed      to be controlled by the president.       The bill is not an unrelieved disaster. It rightly allows      for the expansion of metadata gathering to include more calls      made by cellphones.       Not surprisingly, the bill has received the endorsement of      President Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, and his      director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who in a      Sept. 2 letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee said they      were ``comfortable'' with the bill's provisions--even as they      conceded that the bill may have ``additional impacts that we      will be able to identify only after we start to implement the      new law.''       If that calls to mind the Affordable Care Act and the      suggestion that we should wait and find out what is in the      bill until after it passes, bear in mind that ``additional      impacts'' here may include holes in the ground where      buildings used to stand and empty chairs where people used to      sit.       There is no immediate or emergency need for this piece of      legislation. Current surveillance authorities do not expire      at the end of this year, which is fortunate given the current      threats we face at home and abroad. The USA Freedom Act      should await the attention of the Congress that will actually      oversee it. A change to national-security procedures is not      something to be rushed through in a lame-duck session.",

That is the American standard. It appears now, from what the President has said, that this administration for several years has rejected that standard. The President has assumed the power to eavesdrop on the conversations of innocent Americans on the possibility that they will come up with some evidence of wrongdoing.

(c) Additional Elements.--The strategy required by      subsection (a) shall also provide for the following:       (1) Safeguards to prevent--       (A) the circumvention of operational requirements and      acquisition processes through informal relationships among      the United States Cyber Command, the Armed Forces, the      National Security Agency, and the Defense Information Systems      Agency; and       (B) the abuse of quick-reaction processes otherwise      available for the rapid fielding of capabilities.       (2) The establishment of reporting and oversight processes      for requirements generation and approval for cyber warfare      capabilities, the assignment of responsibility for providing      capabilities to meet such requirements, and the execution of      development and deployment of such capabilities, under the      authority of the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight      Council, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and other      officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, as      designated in the strategy.       (3) The establishment and maintenance of test and      evaluation facilities and resources for cyber infrastructure      to support research and development, operational test and      evaluation, operational planning and effects testing, and      training by replicating or emulating networks and      infrastructure maintained and operated by the military and      political organizations of potential United States      adversaries, by domestic and foreign telecommunications      service providers, and by the Department of Defense.

(5) Appropriate disclosure regarding United States cyber      warfare capabilities to the independent test and evaluation      community, and the involvement of that community in the      development and maintenance of such capabilities, regardless      of classification.       (6) The role of the private sector and appropriate      Department of Defense organizations in developing      capabilities to operate in      cyberspace, and a clear process for determining whether to      allocate responsibility for responding to Department of      Defense cyber warfare requirements through Federal Government      personnel, contracts with private sector entities, or a      combination of both.       (7) The roles of each military department, and of the      combat support Defense Agencies, in the development of cyber      warfare capabilities in support of offensive, defensive, and      intelligence operational requirements.       (8) Mechanisms to promote information sharing, cooperative      agreements, and collaboration with international,      interagency, academic, and industrial partners in the      development of cyber warfare capabilities.       (9) The manner in which the Department of Defense will      promote interoperability, share innovation, and avoid      unproductive duplication in cyber warfare capabilities      through specialization among the components of the Department      responsible for developing cyber capabilities.       (d) Report on Strategy.--       (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the      date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a      report on the strategy required by subsection (a).

All the emails collected through the PRISM component of section 702 go to several other agencies, including the CIA and the FBI. Then we have those three agencies, in particular, authorized to conduct searches through all the data for communications that are to, from, or about Americans: Look for an American's name, telephone number, email address, even a key word or phrase. They can do that without any warrant. There doesn't have to be even a suspicion--even a suspicion--that an American is engaged in any kind of wrongdoing. The FBI's authorities are even broader. The FBI can conduct searches for communications that are to, from, or about an American to seek evidence of a crime. Unlike the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI doesn't even report how many searches for Americans it is conducting. Moreover, neither the FBI nor the CIA reports on the number of searches for Americans that it conducts using metadata collected under section 702.",

        "statement": "(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) On June 23, 2009, the Secretary of Defense directed the      Commander of the United States Strategic Command to establish      the United States Cyber Command, which became operational on      May 21, 2010, and operates as a sub-unified command      subordinate to the United States Strategic Command.       (2) In May 2012, media reports indicated that General      Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,      planned to recommend to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta      that the two-year-old United States Cyber Command be elevated      to full combatant command status.       (3) On August 14, 2012, General Keith Alexander, the      Commander of the United States Cyber Command and the Director      of the National Security Agency, addressed the TechNet Land      Forces conference and stated that ``[i]n 2007 we drafted . .      . a paper . . . about establishing a Cyber Command . . .      [which concluded that] . . . the most logical is to set it up      as a sub unified and grow it to a unified, and I think that's      the process that we're going to work our way through''.       (4) On October 11, 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta      discussed cybersecurity in a speech to the Business      Executives for National Security in New York, New York,      specifically calling for a strengthening of the United States      Cyber Command and stating that the Department of Defense      ``must ensure that [the United States Cyber Command] has the      resources, that it has the authorities, that it has the      capabilities required to perform this growing mission. And it      must also be able to react quickly to events unfolding in      cyberspace and help fully integrate cyber into all of the      department's plans and activities.''.       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--       (1) recognizes the serious cyber threat to national      security and the need to work both offensively and      defensively to protect the Nation's networks and critical      infrastructure;       (2) acknowledges the importance of the unified command      structure of the Department in directing military operations      in cyberspace and recognizes that a change in the status of      the United States Cyber Command has Department-wide and      national security implications, which require careful      consideration;       (3) expects to be briefed and consulted about any proposal      to elevate the United States Cyber Command to a unified      command before a decision by the Secretary make such a      proposal to the President and to receive, at a minimum--       (A) a clear statement of mission and related legal      definitions;       (B) an outline of the specific national security benefits      of elevating the sub-unified United States Cyber Command to a      unified command;       (C) an estimate of the cost of creating a unified United      States Cyber Command and a justification of the expenditure;      and       (D) if the Secretary considers it advisable to continue the      designation of the Commander of the United States Cyber      Command as also being the Director of the National Security      Agency--       (i) an explanation of how a single individual could serve      as a commander of a combatant command that conducts overt,      albeit clandestine, cyber operations under title 10, United      States Code, as well as the director of an intelligence      agency that conducts covert cyber operations under the      National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in a      manner that affords deniability to the United States; and       (ii) a statement of whether the Secretary believes it is      appropriate either to appoint a line officer as the Director      of the National Security Agency or to take the unprecedented      step of appointing an intelligence officer as a unified      commander; and       (4) believes that appropriate policy foundations and      standing rules of engagement must be in place before any      decision to create a unified United States Cyber Command.",

Any portions of the record that were submitted ex      parte during the agency proceedings shall be submitted ex      parte to the Board.       ``(E) Further fact-finding or improper denial.--If the      Board concludes that further fact-finding is necessary or      finds that the agency improperly denied the employee or      former employee the opportunity to present evidence that, if      admitted, would have a substantial likelihood of altering the      outcome, the Board shall remand the matter to the agency from      which it originated for additional proceedings in accordance      with the rules of procedure issued by the Board.       ``(F) De novo determination.--The Board shall make a de      novo determination, based on the entire record and under the      standards specified in paragraph (4), of whether the employee      or former employee received an adverse security clearance or      access determination in violation of paragraph (1). In      considering the record, the Board may weigh the evidence,      judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine      controverted questions of fact. In doing so, the Board may      consider the prior fact-finder's opportunity to see and hear      the witnesses.       ``(G) Adverse security clearance or access determination.--     If the Board finds that the adverse security clearance or      access determination violated paragraph (1), it shall then      separately determine whether reinstating the security      clearance or access determination is clearly consistent with      the interests of national security, with any doubt resolved      in favor of national security, under Executive Order 12968      (60 Fed. Reg. 40245; relating to access to classified      information) or any successor thereto (including any      adjudicative guidelines promulgated under such orders) or any      subsequent Executive order, regulation, or policy concerning      access to classified information.       ``(H) Remedies.--       ``(i) Corrective action.--If the Board finds that the      adverse security clearance or access determination violated      paragraph (1), it shall order the agency head to take      specific corrective action to return the employee or former      employee, as nearly as practicable and reasonable, to the      position such employee or former employee would have held had      the violation not occurred. Such corrective action shall      include reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable      costs incurred, and may include back pay and related      benefits, travel expenses, and compensatory damages not to      exceed $300,000. The Board may recommend, but may not order,      reinstatement or hiring of a former employee. The Board may      order that the former employee be treated as though the      employee were transferring from the most recent position held      when seeking other positions within the executive branch. Any      corrective action shall not include the reinstating of any      security clearance or access determination. The agency head      shall take the actions so ordered within 90 days, unless the      Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Energy,      or the Secretary of Defense, in the case of any component of      the Department of Defense, determines that doing so would      endanger national security.       ``(ii) Recommended action.--If the Board finds that      reinstating the employee or former employee's security      clearance or access determination is clearly consistent with      the interests of national security, it shall recommend such      action to the head of the entity selected under subsection      (b) and the head of the affected agency.       ``(I) Congressional notification.--       ``(i) Orders.--Consistent with the protection of sources      and methods, at the time the Board issues an order, the      Chairperson of the Board shall notify--       ``(I) the Committee on Homeland Security and Government      Affairs of the Senate;       ``(II) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate;       ``(III) the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of      the House of Representatives;       ``(IV) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of      the House of Representatives; and       ``(V) the committees of the Senate and the House of      Representatives that have jurisdiction over the employing      agency, including in the case of a final order or decision of      the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-     Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, or the      National Reconnaissance Office, the Committee on Armed      Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of      the House of Representatives.       ``(ii) Recommendations.--If the agency head and the head of      the entity selected under subsection (b) do not follow the      Board's recommendation to reinstate a clearance, the head of      the entity selected under subsection (b) shall notify the      committees described in subclauses (I) through (V) of clause      (i).       ``(6) Judicial review.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed to permit or require judicial review of any--       ``(A) agency action under this section; or       ``(B) action of the appellate review board established      under section 204 of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement      Act of 2010.       ``(7) Private cause of action.--Nothing in this section      shall be construed to permit, authorize, or require a private      cause of action to challenge the merits of a security      clearance determination.''.       (c) Access Determination Defined.--Section 3001(a) of the      Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (50      U.S.C. 435b(a)) is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(9) The term `access determination' means the process for      determining whether an employee--       ``(A) is eligible for access to classified information in      accordance with Executive Order 12968 (60 Fed.

Reg.      1583; relating to safeguarding classified information with      industry); and       ``(B) possesses a need to know under that Order.''.       (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in section 3001 of the      Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (50      U.S.C. 435b), as amended by this Act, shall be construed to      require the repeal or replacement of agency appeal procedures      implementing Executive Order 12968 (60 Fed.

Sec. 113.  Funds appropriated by this joint resolution may      be obligated and expended notwithstanding section 10 of      Public Law 91-672 (22 U.S.C. 2412), section 15 of the State      Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2680),      section 313 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act,      Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (22 U.S.C. 6212), and section      504(a)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C.      414(a)(1)).

This program, administered by the National Security Agency, has been a critical component in ensuring the safety of millions of Americans. Despite that, Judge Diggs Taylor ruled that the program, which the Government only uses to intercept international telephone and internet communications, violates the first and fourth amendments to the Constitution, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Separation of Powers doctrine, in other words the veritable legal kitchen sink.",

        "statement": "(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) United States government authorities should have the      legal authority to engage in electronic surveillance of any      telephone conversation in which one party is reasonably      believed to be a member or agent of a terrorist organization.       (2) Absent emergency or other appropriate circumstances,      domestic electronic surveillance should be subject to      judicial review in order to protect the privacy of law      abiding Americans with no ties to terrorism.       (3) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978      (FISA) authorizes the President to obtain a warrant for the      electronic surveillance of any telephone conversation in      which one party is reasonably believed to be a member or      agent of a terrorist organization. That Act also establishes      procedures for engaging in electronic surveillance without a      warrant on a temporary basis when emergency circumstances      make obtaining a warrant impractical.       (4) During the quarter century since the enactment of the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Court has issued a warrant for      electronic surveillance in response      to all but 5 of the approximately 19,000 applications for      such a warrant.       (5) Congress has amended the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act of 1978 numerous times, including six times      since September 11, 2001, to streamline the procedures for      obtaining a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Court.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and      the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House      of Representatives must be fully briefed on the history,      operation, and usefulness of the warrantless wiretapping      program carried out by the National Security Agency;       (2) Congress should modify the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act of 1978 as needed to ensure that the      government may engage in electronic surveillance of telephone      conversations in which one party is reasonably believed to be      a member or agent of a terrorist organization;       (3) the requirement that the government must, absent      emergency or other appropriate circumstances, obtain a      judicial warrant prior to engaging in electronic surveillance      of a United States person should remain in place to protect      the privacy of law abiding Americans with no ties to      terrorism; and       (4) the President is not above the law and must abide by      congressionally-enacted procedures for engaging in electronic      surveillance.",

        "statement": "Enough already! It's harmful enough that ideological      conflict and partisan politics are preventing this country      from solving its long-term challenges on health care, fiscal      policy and energy. Now, it's threatening our national      survival.       I do not exaggerate. Bush-hatred has reached such intensity      that CIA officers and other bureaucrats are leaking major      secrets about anti-terrorism policy and communications      intelligence that undermine our ability to fight Islamic      extremism.       Would newspapers in the midst of World War II have printed      the fact that the U.S. had broken German and Japanese codes,      enabling the enemy to secure its communications? Or revealed      how and where Nazi spies were being interrogated? Nowadays,      newspapers win Pulitzer Prizes for such disclosures.       In Congress and in much of the media, the immediate      reaction to news that the National Security Agency was      intercepting international terrorist communications was      not to say, ``Good work--and how can we help?'' Rather, it      was to scream about a ``domestic spying'' scandal, as though      Richard Nixon were back in the White House and tapping the      telephone of Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard      Dean.       And the reaction has been much the same to USA Today's      story last week that the NSA ``has been secretly collecting      the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans'' in      a program that ``reaches into the homes and businesses across      the nation by amassing information about the calls of      ordinary Arericans.''       Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), ranking member on the Senate      Judiciary Committee, reacted by asserting that ``these are      tens of millions of Americans who are not suspected of      anything but we're just going to collect their phone      information for the heck of it. Where does it stop?''       Similarly, Newsweek's cover this week blares ``Spying On      Your Calls''--no question mark used--and implies that the      Bush White House could be tapping everyone's telephones.       In fact, what seems to be happening, though the details are      secret, is that most long-distance phone companies have given      the NSA their billing records identifying what numbers are      calling what other nmbers, when and for how long. Names are      not included. And the NSA--not for the heck of it but to      protect us from attack--is using the records to track      terrorist networks and calling patterns. If a known terrorist      in Pakistan calls a number in Los Angeles, I want the      government to know what numbers that person calls. Don't you?       Certainly, the government will find out the names of people      in a terrorist calling chain. If it wants to tap a domestic      phone, it needs a warrant and, unless officials are lying      through their teeth, it is asking for them.       The NSA call logs also apparently are being mined to      establish patterns of terrorist-related communication--the      use of pay phones, duration of calls, times of communication,      etc.       But all this scarcely constitutes ``reaching into homes and      businesses across the nation.'' If the government is snooping      into the business of anyone except terrorists (or drug      dealers, Mafiosi and child pornographers, whose names and      numbers also can be easily obtained with a subpoena), it is      wasting its time and our money.       The phone companies that are cooperating with the      government ought to be congratulated for participating in the      war on terrorism--as they would have been in WWII. Instead,      they are being hauled before the Senate Judiciary Committee      as though they were criminals. And trial lawyers are circling      like vultures to make them pay zillions for alleged privacy      violations.       As for myself, I'm sticking with AT as a long-distance      carrier because (according to news reports), it did      cooperate. If I had Qwest, which reportedly refused, I'd      cancel.       Is there a potential for abuse in the NSA spying program?      There is. For instance, it would be all too easy for      officials to ask the NSA to trace the phone records of the      winners of those odious Pulitzers--James Risen of The New      York Times and Dana Priest of The Washington Post--in an      effort to uncover their sources in the name of ``protecting      secrets'' and ``fighting terrorism.''       The Senate Intelligence Committee, when it quizzes former      NSA Director Michael Hayden in his CIA confirmation hearings      Friday, should establish that the terrorist surveillance      programs have not been abused, although there is no evidence      of it.       To the extent he can do so without giving away secrets,      Hayden also should tell the committee and the country why      these programs are so essential and what the legal basis for      them is.       If the administration believes, as officials often have      said, that the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is      obsolete in the age of super-computers and terrorism, it      ought to work with Congress to rewrite the law. Skirting it      won't work anymore.       But the fundamental problem infecting much of Congress, the      media and the political class especially those, left of      center--is that they are consumed with loathing for President      Bush and all his works and are prepared to do anything to      undermine him, even if it makes the country less safe.       Yes, Republicans tried to destroy former President Bill      Clinton over sex and politics. But now Democrats what to      destroy Bush so badly that they are willing to undercut      national security.       Everyone in Congress (and the CIA) should see the movie      ``United 93'' as a reminder of what we are up against, Muslim      fanatics will not only try to destroy the Capitol, but also      explode a nuclear bomb, if they can.       And, people also should heed the warning delivered by      Princeton University professor Bernard Lewis, one of the      nation's foremost scholars of Islam, before the Pew Forum on      Religion and Public Life here last month.       Lewis, now 90, cast the struggle with Islamic extremism in      WWII terms--it is 1938, he said, and ``we seem to be more in      the mode of Chamberlain at Munich rather than of Churchill.''       Osama bin Laden and other would-be Hitlers, he said,      consider the United States ``an effete, degenerate, pampered      enemy incapable of real resistance.'' It's part of the      pattern that we fight among ourselves as much as against our      enemies. This is more than serious. It's dire.",

        "statement": "Our political disagreements are often obtuse for the simple      reason that it is difficult to discern motives. Do disputants      put the interests of the country ahead of partisan and      personal concerns? Moreover, disagreements about intelligence      issues are doubly hard to parse, since--despite leaks and      rampant gossip--most of what goes on inside the Central      Intelligence Agency remains opaque even to high-paid      journalists and other Washington sophisticates. And so, amid      partisan positioning and an imposing ignorance, is the scene      set for the already dismaying dispute over the president's      nomination of Michael Hayden to be CIA director.       The arguments (to use a generous term) being made against      Gen. Hayden are so without merit or even serious content that      one cannot help but suspect partisan stratagems at work. Of      these, three are most common.        First, the contention that Michael Hayden is a kind of      intelligence technocrat, knowledgeable only in signal      intelligence, is pure canard. A liberal-arts man, Gen. Hayden      has a masters degree in history, and was the broad-based      senior intelligence official for the Air Force and the U.S.      European Command before entering the technical domain of the      National Security Agency. He worked on the National Security      Council staff, in the U.N. Command and U.S. Forces Korea, and      in these positions was a senior level consumer of      intelligence as well as an earlier producer of it. Those who      make such accusations do not know him or, more broadly, what      they are talking about.       Some complain, secondly, that Gen. Hayden was somehow      complicit in the domestic eavesdropping undertaken by the NSA      at the president's direction. Gen. Hayden's sin in this case      seems to stem from his calm and rational defense of an      embattled president's heretofore secret program. No legal      infractions attended anyone's behavior in what was, and      remains, a policy response to a clear and present threat.      Moreover, if Gen. Hayden had objected--having been assured by      the attorney general, the Department of Justice, the White      House counsel and the NSA general counsel that the program      was legal--his position would have been unprofessional and      ill-advised.       Third, there is the objection that Gen. Hayden is, well, a      general--a military man--as if that automatically      disqualifies him for the job. Since the National Security Act      of 1947 created the CIA, four military officers have held the      director's job--plus two more who directed the postwar      predecessor to the CIA. So there is ample precedent for Gen.      Hayden's nomination. But the complaint here is not so much      about precedent as the presumption that Gen. Hayden would      docilely do the bidding of the bureaucratic imperium      represented by the present secretary of defense. To      believe this is to ignore his professional history.       Gen. Hayden was the only high-ranking active-duty general      to testify against Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's desires as the      National Intelligence Directorate was debated by Congress in      2004. He did so, he believed, in the interests of a more      rational template for oversight, and control of those      intelligence agencies now under the Defense Department whose      customers are multidepartmental. Gen. Hayden was a man of      convictions with the courage to defend them when he was a      lieutenant colonel, and has lost neither of those      characteristics as he ascended into the senior ranks of his      profession.       Most important, the best guarantee against coercion of the      CIA director by any cabinet-level official--or president--may      be stated in one word: professionalism. And Michael Hayden,      as I have observed for nearly 20 years, is a professional par      excellence.       Those who wish to harm the president seem intent on using      Gen. Hayden as a bank shot into the Oval Office. This is a      great shame, and stands to be an important missed      opportunity, for the confirmation process--were it to focus      truly on the national interest--could do a great deal of good      at this time of tumult in the intelligence community.       There has been, for a long time, a tendency on the part of      some presidents to select CIA directors who were amateurs in      the craft. Their political or ideological leanings have      sometimes been a more important factor in their appointment      than their knowledge and capabilities in the arcane world of      intelligence. With those chosen for such reasons comes a      weakened ability to resist pressure to marshal intelligence      in ways tailored to support the policy objectives of a      president: pressure to give the president what he wants      rather than what he needs. It is fair, I believe, to claim      that the intelligence failures of recent years were a long      time in the making, and that they were failures not so much      of the institution but of a flawed intelligence leadership      selection process.       ``Amateur'' is not, by definition, a swear word; we have      had, on occasion, some very talented non-professional      directors of Central Intelligence. But there is no substitute      for the professional knowledge and ethos at the top that      legitimate and protect the intelligence function from a host      of political pressures and insinuations.       Gen. Hayden's confirmation hearings should, first of all,      result in his confirmation. But beyond that, the hearings      could do the country an important service if they were to      consider a more thoroughgoing reform--modeling the key      intelligence positions in the U.S. government on that of the      chairman of the Federal Reserve, or of the Joint Chiefs,      whose term does not run parallel to that of the president,      and whose professional credentials are critical elements in      his selection. More than anything else the Congress can do,      such a reform would help restore the professionalism that is      crucial to the intelligence function in a democracy. That      would be no bank shot, but a slam-dunk for national security.",

I fear that the language of the report could have unintended consequences for the on-going efforts to modernize the National Security Agency. The report mandates that the NSA manage its modernization effort as though it were a traditional major defense acquisition program. If this mandate were applied to each of the individual technology efforts within the NSA, such a requirement could impede NSA's flexibility to modernize and upgrade its capabilities. I would ask the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee whether this was the Committee's intent?",

However, I note the concerns you raise and agree that the report should not be read to mandate treating each individual technology effort within NSA as a major acquisition program. As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee knows, the Department of Defense (DoD) has an extensive effort to develop various technology projects that could ultimately contribute to one or more major DoD acquisition programs. DoD does not manage these individual technology projects as major acquisition programs, despite the fact that they may contribute to successful fielding of a program being managed as a major acquisition program.",

        "statement": "Washington.--The United States informed its NATO allies      this month that Russia had tested a new ground-launched      cruise missile, raising concerns about Moscow's compliance      with a landmark arms control accord.       American officials believe Russia began conducting flight      tests of the missile as early as 2008. Such tests are      prohibited by the treaty banning medium-range missiles that      was signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S.      Gorbachev, the Soviet leader at the time, and that has long      been viewed as one of the bedrock accords that brought an end      to the Cold War.       Beginning in May, Rose Gottemoeller, the State Department's      senior arms control official, has repeatedly raised the      missile tests with Russian officials, who have responded that      they investigated the matter and consider the case to be      closed. But Obama administration officials are not yet ready      to formally declare the tests of the missile, which has not      been deployed, to be a violation of the 1987 treaty.       With President Obama pledging to seek deeper cuts in      nuclear arms, the State Department has been trying to find a      way to resolve the compliance issue, preserve the treaty and      keep the door open to future arms control accords.       ``The United States never hesitates to raise treaty      compliance concerns with Russia, and this issue is no      exception,'' Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman,      said. ``There's an ongoing review process, and we wouldn't      want to speculate or prejudge the outcome.''       Other officials, who asked not to be identified because      they were discussing internal deliberations, said there was      no question the missile tests ran counter to the treaty and      the administration had already shown considerable patience      with the Russians. And some members of Congress, who have      been briefed on the tests on a classified basis for well over      a year, have been pressing the White House for a firmer      response.       A public dispute over the tests could prove to be a major      new irritant in the already difficult relationship between      the United States and Russia. In recent months, that      relationship has been strained by differences over how to end      the fighting in Syria; the temporary asylum granted to Edward      J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor;      and, most recently, the turmoil in Ukraine.       The treaty banning the testing, production and possession      of medium-range missiles has long been regarded as a major      step toward curbing the American and Russian arms race. ``The      importance of this treaty transcends numbers,'' Mr. Reagan      said during the treaty signing, adding that it underscored      the value of ``greater openness in military programs and      forces.''       But after President Vladimir V. Putin rose to power and the      Russian military began to re-evaluate its strategy, the      Kremlin developed second thoughts about the accord. During      the administration of President George W. Bush, Sergei B.      Ivanov, the Russian defense minister, proposed that the two      sides drop the treaty.       Though the Cold War was over, he argued that Russia still      faced threats from nations on its periphery, including China      and potentially Pakistan. But the Bush administration was      reluctant to terminate a treaty that NATO nations regarded as      a cornerstone of arms control and whose abrogation would have      enabled the Russians to increase missile forces directed at      the United States' allies in Asia.       Since Mr. Obama has been in office, the Russians have      insisted they want to keep the agreement. But in the view of      American analysts, Russia has also mounted a determined      effort to strengthen its nuclear abilities to compensate for      the weakness of its conventional, nonnuclear forces.       At the same time, in his State of the Union address last      year, Mr. Obama vowed to ``seek further reductions in our      nuclear arsenals,'' a goal American officials at one point      hoped might form part of Mr. Obama's legacy.       But administration officials and experts outside government      say Congress is highly unlikely to approve an agreement      mandating more cuts unless the question of Russian compliance      with the medium-range treaty is resolved.       ``If the Russian government has made a considered decision      to field a prohibited system,'' Franklin C. Miller, a former      defense official at the White House and the Pentagon, said,      ``then it is the strongest indication to date that they are      not interested in pursuing any arms control, at least through      the remainder of President Obama's term.''       It took years for American intelligence to gather      information on Russia's new missile system, but by the end of      2011, officials say it was clear that there was a compliance      concern.       There have been repeated rumors over the last year that      Russia may have violated some of the provisions of the 1987      treaty. But the nature of that violation has not previously      been disclosed, and some news reports have focused on the      wrong system: a new two-stage missile called the RS-26. The      Russians have flight-tested it at medium range, according to      intelligence assessments, and the prevailing view among      Western officials is that it is intended to help fill the gap      in Russia's medium-range missile capabilities that resulted      from the 1987 treaty. The      treaty defines medium-range missiles as ground-launched      ballistic or cruise missiles capable of flying 300 to 3,400      miles.       But because Russia has conducted a small number of tests of      the RS-26 at intercontinental range, it technically qualifies      as a long-range system and will be counted under the treaty      known as New Start, which was negotiated by the Obama      administration. So it is generally considered by Western      officials to be a circumvention, but not a violation, of the      1987 treaty       One member of Congress who was said to have raised concerns      that the suspected arms control violation might endanger      future arms control efforts was John Kerry. As a senator and      chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he received a      classified briefing on the matter in November 2012 that dealt      with compliance concerns, according to a report in The Daily      Beast.       As secretary of state, Mr. Kerry has not raised concerns      over the cruise missile tests with his Russian counterpart,      Sergey V. Lavrov, but he has emphasized the importance of      complying with arms accords, a State Department official      said.       Republican lawmakers, however, have urged the      administration to be more aggressive.       ``Briefings provided by your administration have agreed      with our assessment that Russian actions are serious and      troubling, but have failed to offer any assurance of any      concrete action to address these Russian actions,''      Representative Howard McKeon, Republican of California and      chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative      Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who leads the      Intelligence Committee, said in an April letter to Mr. Obama.       And Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, and 16 other      Republican senators recently proposed legislation that would      require the White House to report to Congress on what      intelligence the United States has shared with NATO allies on      suspected violations of the 1987 treaty.       Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee have also cited the issue in holding up Ms.      Gottemoeller's confirmation as under secretary of state for      arms control and international security.       It was against this backdrop that the so-called deputies      committee, an interagency panel led by Antony Blinken, Mr.      Obama's deputy national security adviser, decided that Ms.      Gottemoeller should inform NATO's 28 members about the      compliance issue.       On Jan. 17, Ms. Gottemoeller discussed the missile tests in      a closed-door meeting of NATO's Arms Control, Disarmament and      Non-Proliferation Committee that she led in Brussels.       The Obama administration, she said, had not given up on      diplomacy. There are precedents for working out disputes over      arms control complaints, and Ms. Gottemoeller said American      officials would continue to engage the Russians to try to      resolve the controversy.       But even with the best of intentions, establishing what the      Russians are doing may not be easy. The elaborate network of      verification provisions created under the medium-range      missile treaty is no longer in effect, since all the missiles      that were believed to be covered by the agreement were long      thought to have been destroyed by May 1991.",

        "statement": "Dear Mr. Speaker: The American people are losing confidence      in their government. The tragedy in Benghazi, along with a      stream of recent controversies, including the IRS and the      Justice Department's targeting of reporters at Fox News and      the Associated Press, as well as the ambiguity about recently      disclosed programs at the National Security Agency, are      eroding public trust in the institutions of government.       This diminishing of public confidence isn't limited to the      Executive Branch. Congress' approval rating is at an all-time      low. A June 14 National Journal article said, ``Nearly 8 in      10 Americans told Gallup pollsters this month that they      disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job, the 45th      consecutive month that more than two-thirds of Americans      graded Congress poorly. The problem isn't as much what      Congress is doing as what it is not getting done.'' I believe      most Americans would agree that one of the items ``not      getting done'' is a thorough, comprehensive and ultimately      definitive investigation into the response to the Benghazi      attacks.       That is why I have been pushing so hard for a bipartisan      Select Committee to investigate the September 11, 2012      terrorist attack in Benghazi. The response among most of our      colleagues and the public has been overwhelming. Since      January, when I proposed including the Select Committee in      the House Rules package for the 113th Congress, more than      two-thirds of House Republicans--a majority of the majority--     have cosponsored my bill, H. Res. 36, to create the Select      Committee. Since that time, there has been a growing chorus      of support. The bill has been endorsed by the parents of some      of the victims, by more than 700 retired Special Operations      officials, by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers      Associations, which represents the State Department security      officers who were on the ground in Benghazi, and by The Wall      Street Journal editorial page in addition to dozens of other      commentators, former diplomats and military officials. I      believe this broad support speaks to the public's hunger for      clear answers on Benghazi--answers which to date have been      elusive. That is why more than nine months after the      devastating attack, my resolution continues to add new      cosponsors; it now has the support of 158 Republicans.       I recognize that ``regular order'' has made some progress      over the last six months; most notably Chairman Issa's      constructive hearing with several State Department      whistleblowers. I also understand that Chairman McKeon has      planned a hearing with Gen. Carter Ham for next week, but      like so many of these hearings, this, too, will be held      behind closed doors. There is no reason Gen. Ham's      testimony shouldn't be public. This latest classified      hearing is symptomatic of a broader problem with respect      to the current congressional approach to investigating      Benghazi: Too much has been done in a piecemeal fashion,      behind closed doors,      thereby robbing the American people of clear answers to      important questions surrounding the murder of a sitting      U.S. ambassador and three civilian employees, and the      grievous injury of untold others.       Deuteronomy 16:20 tells us, ``Justice, justice shalt thou      pursue.'' As we quietly marked the nine-month anniversary of      the attacks last week, I know many people wondered if there      will ever be any clear resolution to this investigation, let      alone justice.       Writing about Benghazi in The Wall Street Journal last      month, columnist Peggy Noonan pondered, ``Was all this      incompetence? Or was it politics disguised as the fog of war?      Who called these shots and made these decisions? Who decided      to do nothing?''       More than nine months later, the Congress still cannot      answer these questions. No one has been held responsible for      the failure to respond that night. A few mid-level career      officials have been penalized, but ultimately those senior      officials who were in the position to actually say the buck      stops here--cabinet secretaries and political appointees at      the White House, State Department, Defense Department and      CIA--have emerged unscathed, and in some cases, seemingly the      better for it.       Consider that former Secretary Clinton now earns hundreds      of thousands of dollars for every speech she gives, former      Secretary Panetta just signed a $3 million book deal and      former CIA Director Petraeus recently joined an investment      firm in New York.       Similarly, several other administration officials      associated with the Benghazi response to the attack have been      promoted. Ambassador Rice has been promoted to national      security advisor, then-deputy national security advisor      Dennis McDonough has been promoted to White House chief of      staff, and then-White House chief of staff Jack Lew has been      promoted to Treasury Secretary.       If all responsible for the government's response to      Benghazi have been rewarded with lucrative contracts or      promotions within the administration, what signal does this      send to the American people about accountability?       Mr. Speaker, we're fast approaching the Independence Day      recess. We will only have four legislative weeks in July      before the August recess. When we return in September we will      be just days away from the one-year anniversary of the      Benghazi attacks.       We must not wait until the second year of this      investigation to commit the focused resources of a Select      Committee in pursuit of government accountability and,      ultimately, truth. Sources are disappearing and leads are      drying up. The Select Committee legislation needs to be      Swiftly brought to the floor for a vote, so the House can      hold public hearings over the summer--focused exclusively on      the core issues about why no assistance was sent to the      Americans under fire in Benghazi--and attempt to provide a      final public report by the first anniversary of this attack.       You have a number of committee chairman who would be      excellent at leading the Select Committee. Chairman Issa has      shown in his hearing with the State Department whistleblowers      that he would be a good chairman. Similarly, Chairman Royce,      Chairman Rogers, Chairman McKeon, Chairman Goodlatte and      Chairman McCaul are all strong leaders and would ably chair a      Select Committee. Further, we have a lot of talent in our      conference to draw from. There are a number of newer members      who have proven themselves to be capable and insightful      investigators. You could consider appointing some of them to      the Select Committee, too.       As I mentioned earlier, a number of new controversies      involving the Obama Administration have surfaced in recent      months that demand the committees' full attention. This is      all the more reason to take the best of the best under a      Select Committee to build, at no additional cost, on the work      that has already been done through regular order. There would      be no need to start over, as some have tried to say. Nor      would there be additional costs--the resolution specifically      states that we should use existing resources.       We owe it to the families of the Benghazi victims and to      the not yet named survivors, whose lives will be indelibly      marked by the wounds they endured protecting the annex, to      honor their sacrifice and their service. Harkening back to      Deuteronomy, we must pursue justice on their behalf,      recognizing their heroism and an accounting for the failures      in leadership that left them exposed and vulnerable. We also      owe it to the men and women who serve our country now and in      the years ahead to restore confidence that if they come under      fire, we will make every effort to come to their defense. For      these reasons alone, we should not give up on this issue.       I am afraid that if we don't move on a Select Committee,      we'll never find out the truth. Just as The Wall Street      Journal editorial page in May said, ``A Select Committee is      the only means available now for the U.S. political system to      extricate itself from the labyrinth called Benghazi.''       The need for a Select Committee is underscored by the      difficulty we're having getting answers on a number of      current investigations. Consider that in the case of the IRS      scandal, both the Ways and Means Committee and the Oversight      and Government Reform Committee have opened up independent      investigations that will likely take significant resources      for months to come. It is important that they investigate,      and they are doing an excellent job. But despite these      efforts, much remains unknown about the IRS scandal--which      involves only a single agency and does not have to deal with      sensitive, classified information--including whether the      political targeting of groups was confined to the Cincinnati      office or was actually directed by Washington. We still don't      have a clear answer.       In comparison, the Benghazi case cuts across multiple      national security agencies and the White House involving      sensitive information, thereby putting it in a league of its      own among the various scandal investigations. Also of great      interest is the increasing concern that the FBI is being used      by various agencies as an excuse to avoid answering      questions on Benghazi, especially as this investigation      drags on longer. The American people should be troubled by      the anemic pace of the FBI's investigation of those      responsible for the attacks. Nearly a year later, the U.S.      does not have a single suspect in custody. The Tunisians      released one suspect earlier this year, after making the      FBI wait for months to interview him. Another person of      significant interest has been held since last fall by the      Egyptian government, a recipient of billions of dollars in      U.S. foreign assistance, but they will not allow the FBI      to interview him.       Even more concerning, last month the Associated Press      reported that the FBI allegedly has identified five men      believed to be responsible for the Benghazi attacks, but      won't detain them because it does not have enough evidence to      try them in a U.S. civilian court. For the U.S. to know the      identities and possible locations of those who killed four      Americans and fail to take action immediately because the      administration insists on an Article III trial is shameful.      For these reasons, any worthwhile Benghazi investigation must      also consider how the Justice Department has managed its      investigation into the terrorists over the last year.       Despite these serious issues, much of the House's      investigation on Benghazi to date has centered on secondary      discussions like the ``talking points'' and the      Accountability Review Board process, to the detriment of more      fundamental issues like the administration's apparent      abandonment of Americans who were facing a deadly siege.       On the issues that matter most, there is nothing that      happened that deadly night in Benghazi that can't be      addressed in a public hearing and accompanying report of      findings. There are ways to protect classified information      while still allowing the public to learn what actually      happened that night. There is no legitimate reason that the      public shouldn't know what calls for help were made from      Benghazi, who received those calls and, most importantly, why      no support was sent to the Americans under siege. There is no      reason that officials in the chain of command at various      agencies shouldn't be asked to answer publicly why no effort      was made to rescue those in Benghazi.       It has been repeated often that there were no military      assets in the region that could have responded in time to      stop the initial attack on the consulate. But when the      attacks started, no one could have known whether it would      last eight minutes, eight hours, or eight days, or longer. It      appears that not even a single plane was scrambled. We can't      help but draw the deeply troubling conclusion that within      minutes of the attack, the decision was made that the battle      was lost and the Americans left there would be collateral      damage in the greater War on Terror.       If our government never sent a plane to help defend the      annex, it begs the question: Did they even send an American      plane to get the bodies and survivors out of Benghazi after      the attacks? There's no reason the public should not learn      the answer to this question, too.       As Lt. Gen. William. G. Boykin (ret.) and other former      Special Operations officials have noted, a bedrock American      ethos--that our nation never leaves anyone behind on the      battlefield--was shattered that night in Benghazi. No one      came to rescue them despite pleas for help. More than nine      months later, too many questions remain unanswered: Who took      the call that night? What were they told and how did they      respond? Why was the determination made not to intervene in a      horrific assault on a U.S. diplomat and his brave support      staff?       In the dangerous world in which we live there are      undoubtedly hard fought battles where American blood is      spilled, and lives lost--our nation is painfully aware of      this reality through our experience in distant lands like      Iraq and Afghanistan. But Benghazi was an unanticipated      battlefield where terrorist elements seized on the occasion      of the anniversary of 9/11 to strike at an American outpost      abroad. They did so with deadly consequence, and their attack      was met with silence from a superpower.       This is a black mark on our national history. It emboldens      others with similarly gruesome aims. It leaves vulnerable      Americans serving in dangerous posts. And ultimately, the      lack of transparency from the various government agencies and      entities involved undermines the faith of the American people      in their government.       This is a less obvious ``casualty'' of that dark day, but      it has lasting implications which we as public servants know      well. For in a functioning democracy there is a sacred trust      that must exist between the government and the governed and      that trust is precipitously eroding.       As the Wall Street Journal noted in its May editorial,      ``Let Benghazi's chips fall. The House should appoint a      Select Committee.''       Best wishes.           Sincerely,                                                    Frank R. Wolf,                                               Member of Congress. ",

They understand that we need to protect this country. I think they understand this Nation is at war. It is at war with terrorism. And I think they are beginning to understand, as I am beginning to understand, that this didn't start with 9/11, it started in the 1990s--maybe even as far back as 1979 when we began to have terrorist attacks on embassies and ships and planes and various symbols of prosperity in the Western World.

        "statement": "The past year has been tumultuous for Sen. Arlen Specter      (R-Pa.), but he has emerged from its trials triumphant.       It is not quite 12 months since the lawmaker announced he      had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer.      In his statement disclosing his ailment and the imminent      start of chemotherapy, Specter said, ``I have beaten a brain      tumor, bypass heart surgery and many tough political      opponents, and I'm going to beat this, too.''       He has been as good as his word. He lost his hair but      continued to shoulder his heavy workload (and to keep in      shape playing squash before he got to his desk in the      morning). He was never absent, and his hair is back. At 75,      Specter is looking spry.       At the time of his diagnosis, the senator had only just      secured his chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, after a      tough battle against conservative Republicans who feared he      would not fight hard for conservative Supreme Court justices      should President Bush have the opportunity to nominate them.       Those fears have proved unfounded. There are now two new      members of the high court, Chief Justice John Roberts and      Justice Samuel Alito, whose conservative credentials are not      in doubt. Those on the right trust and hope (just as those on      the left believe and fear) that the new justices, replacing      the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra      Day O'Connor, will move the court toward conservative      textualism and away from the ``living Constitution'' ideas      that have produced liberal change on social issues for the      past two generations.       It is Specter, a supporter of abortion rights, who has      presided over these changes to the bench. And he has done so      with aplomb and without any hint either of truckling to those      on either his right or his left. He rejected, for example,      conservative demands that Alito's confirmation hearings be      brought forward in December so that the nominee would not be      left hanging out as a target for too long. At the same time,      he did not allow his own ideological positions to blind him      to the nominees' obvious qualifications. Alito's and      Roberts's critics were given ample time to air their      concerns, yet both were steered swiftly and comparatively      easily to confirmation.       Bush must surely be well-satisfied with his decision in      2004 to back Specter's re-election despite their obvious      differences in ideology, temperament and outlook.       Specter is not resting on his laurels. His agenda is      dominating Senate business. He is presiding over a Judiciary      investigation of the National Security Agency's controversial      terrorist surveillance program. And his asbestos reform bill,      an effort to clean up a mountain of debilitating litigation,      is atop the legislative calendar put together by Majority      Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.).       People who know Specter rarely make the error of      underestimating him. They are even less likely to do so      following his performance in the past 12 months.",

Understand that this was at a big, open technology conference. General Alexander said that when the NSA sweeps up communications from a ``good guy,'' which I think we all assume is a law-abiding American, the NSA has ``requirements from the FISA court and the Attorney General to minimize that, which means nobody else can see it unless there is a crime that is being committed.'' Now, anybody who hears that phrase says: That is pretty good. I imagine that is what people in that technology meeting and the conference call wanted to hear. The only problem is that it is not true. It is not true at all. The privacy protections provided by these minimization procedures are simply not as strong as General Alexander made them out to be.",

This is in complete contravention of the fourth amendment and in complete contravention of the law at that time. As I am sure many of my colleagues will certainly recall, this was revealed to the American people 4 years later when it was reported in the New York Times in 2005. In response, after years of back and forth contentious debate, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act--the bill we are considering on this floor today. We are considering a reauthorization. This law gave the government new surveillance authority but also included a sunset provision to ensure that Congress examines where the law is working and the way it was intended.",

On the same day we voted on the PATRIOT Act conference report last December, when the conference report wasn't allowed to go forward, the New York Times reported that the President had authorized a secret program to eavesdrop on American citizens without warrants required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That story had a clear impact on the vote that day, as it well should have. There was some question why we were even having this protracted debate over the PATRIOT Act, since the President seemed to believe he was free to ignore the laws we enact anyway. But, in fact, no one is above the law--not even the President of the United States. One lesson of the NSA spying scandal is that Congress must stand up to the President and must insist on additional checks on the powers exercised by the executive branch. That is what we are doing today with this PATRIOT Act.",

Again, and again, the administration has refused to join in serious negotiations with Republicans and Democrats on matters of national security, including the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretaps and the FBI's use of national security letters. The latest proposal offers improvements and deserves to pass; however, it is unacceptable and undemocratic that further amendments could not even be considered.",

        "statement": "I asked a former colleague who retired from the CIA not      long ago what he thought about the Washington Post article      Monday, July 19, on the explosion of contractors in the      intelligence community. ``It's a horror,'' he said, ``my tax      money blowing around Washington like confetti.'' But he      reserved his angriest comments for the contractor-driven      bureaucracy that allowed a Nigerian would-be suicide bomber--     as alleged by a resulting federal indictment--to board a      Northwest flight from Amsterdam to Detroit in December. In      spite of the billions and billions of dollars we've showered      on contractors, consultants and corporate contracts since 9/     11, no one managed to disseminate a warning from the      Nigerian's father that his son had reportedly become a      terrorist.       The raw numbers in the Post tell the story. Since 9/11,      America's intelligence budget has more than doubled, to $75      billion. The number of people working at the Defense      Intelligence Agency has gone from 7,500 to 16,500. The FBI's      Joint Terrorism Task Forces have trebled in number, rising      from 35 to io6. Personnel at the National Security Agency has      doubled. There are 854,000 people with top-secret security      clearances, including contractors--almost 1\\1/2\\ times the      population of Washington. It shouldn't come as a surprise,      then, that the Nigerian slipped through the cracks: there are      so many more cracks now.       But we shouldn't reduce the problem to our having become a      country saddled with a bureaucratic Frankenstein of      timeservers and people cashing in on 9/11. Recently I've been      giving talks at government agencies working on      counterterrorism. With almost no exceptions, I've found my      audiences, including contractors, better informed, more      dedicated and better educated than the generation I served      with in the CIA. (As I've said elsewhere, if I were applying      to the CIA today, I wonder whether I'd make it in.) The      problem is that I came away from these talks with the      impression that the post-9/11 workforce is bored and even      adrift--at least in the sense that there are too many people      chasing too little hard intelligence.       It's a tooth-to-tail problem. CIA Director Leon Panetta has      gone on the record as saying there are only a couple hundred      al-Qaeda dead-enders in the mountains between Paldstan and      Afghanistan, most of whom are dormant, hiding in caves. With      a prey so small and elusive and a bureaucracy so Washington-     bound, it shouldn't come as a surprise that we're tripping      over ourselves. Nor should it come as a surprise that more      money and more contractors aren't a problem of diminishing      returns but rather one of adding to the risk.       It would be considerably different if we could put this new      workforce in the field--for instance, in Afghanistan, a      country that demands years and years of on-the-ground      experience for a young American intelligence officer to      understand it. But our bases there are already overflowing      with combat forces, and anyhow, it's too dangerous for      Americans to get outside the wire to meet Afghans. Not unlike      in Washington, they're stuck behind desks and forced to look      at the country from a distance.       No one intended to create a monster bureaucracy after 9/     11--Washington has always thrown money and people at a      problem rather than good ideas. But now someone has to      seriously calculate the damage the outsourcing of      intelligence is causing. The story I keep hearing over and      over is that the bright young people who came to Washington      to fight terrorism--civil servants and contractors alike--     have become disillusioned, and they will soon turn away from      idealism and begin to transform their jobs into comfortable      careers. In the case of the contractors, it means more      contracts and more contractors. It's all the worse because      there are now contractors writing their own contracts.       For Washington to retake control of intelligence, it needs      to remember that intelligence is inherently a governmental      function, no different from the courts, the police or      legislation. I wish Washington good luck in taking back      ground from the contractors, and I hope it can move faster      than the next would-be suicide bomber.",

        "statement": "Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We write to urge you to      bring cyber security legislation to the floor as soon as      possible. Given the time left in this legislative session and      the upcoming election this fall, we are concerned that the      window of opportunity to pass legislation that is in our view      critically necessary to protect our national and economic      security is quickly disappearing.       We have spoken a number of times in recent months on the      cyber threat--that it is imminent, and that it represents one      of the most serious challenges to our national security since      the onset of the nuclear age sixty years ago. It appears that      this message has been received by many in Congress--and yet      we still await conclusive legislative action.       We support the areas that have been addressed so far, most      recently in the House: the importance of strengthening the      security of the federal government's computer networks,      investing in cyber research and development, and fostering      information sharing about cyber threats and vulnerabilities      across government agencies and with the private sector. We      urge the Senate to now keep the ball moving forward in these      areas by bringing legislation to the floor as soon as      possible.       In addition, we also feel that protection of our critical      infrastructure is essential in order to effectively protect      our nation, and economic security from the growing cyber      threat. Infrastructure that controls our electricity, water      and sewer, nuclear plants, communications backbone, energy      pipelines and financial networks must be required to meet      appropriate cyber security standards. Where market forces and      existing regulations have failed to drive appropriate      security, we believe that our government must do what it can      to ensure the protection of our critical infrastructure.      Performance standards in some cases will be necessary--these      standards should be technology neutral, and risk and outcome      based. We do not believe that this requires the imposition of      detailed security regimes in every instance, but some      standards must be minimally required or promoted through the      offer of positive incentives such as liability protection and      availability of clearances.       Various drafts of legislation have attempted to address      this important area--the Lieberman/Collins bill having      received the most traction until recently. We will not      advocate one approach over another--however, we do feel      strongly that critical infrastructure protection needs to be      addressed in any cyber security legislation. The risk is      simply too great considering the reality of our      interconnected and interdependent world, and the impact that      can result from the failure of even one part of the network      across a wide range of physical, economic and social systems.       Finally, we have commented previously about the important      role that the National Security Agency (NSA) can and does      play in the protection of our country against cyber threats.      A piece of malware sent from Asia to the United States could      take as little as 30 milliseconds to traverse such distance.      Preventing and defending against such attacks requires the      ability to respond to them in real-time. NSA is the only      agency dedicated to breaking the codes and understanding the      capabilities and intentions of potential enemies, even before      they hit ``send.'' Any legislation passed by Congress should      allow the public and private sectors to harness the      capabilities of the NSA to protect our critical      infrastructure from malicious actors.       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been      averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do      not want to be in the same position again when `cyber 9/11'      hits--it is not a question of `whether' this will happen; it      is a question of `when.'       Therefore we urge you to bring cyber security legislation      to the floor as soon as possible.           Sincerely,     Hon. Michael Chertoff,     Hon. J. Mike McConnell,     Hon. Paul Wolfowitz,     Gen. Michael Hayden,     Gen. James Cartwright (RET),     Hon. William Lynn III.",

        "statement": "Dear Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Feinstein, and Members of      the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: We the      undersigned civil society organizations, security experts,      and academics write to explain how the Cybersecurity      Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA), would significantly      undermine privacy and civil liberties. We now know that the      National Security Agency (NSA) has secretly collected the      personal information of millions of users, and the revelation      of these programs has created a strong need to rein in,      rather than expand, government surveillance. CISA disregards      the fact that information sharing can--and to be truly      effective, must--offer both security and robust privacy      protections. The legislation fails to achieve these critical      objectives by including:       Automatic NSA access to personal information shared with a      governmental entity;       Inadequate protections prior to sharing;       Dangerous authorization for countermeasures; and       Overbroad authorization for law enforcement use.       For the following reasons, we urge rejection of CISA in its      current form:       Automatic NSA Access to Personal Information and      Communications: Since the summer of 2013, NSA surveillance      activities, such as the telephony metadata bulk collection      program and the PRISM program, have raised nationwide alarm.      CISA ignores these objections, and requires real time      dissemination to military and intelligence agencies,      including the NSA. Congress should be working to limit the      NSA's overbroad authorities to conduct surveillance, rather      than passing a bill that would increase the NSA's access to      personal information and private communications.       Automatic sharing with NSA risks not only privacy, but also      effectiveness. During a recent House Intelligence Committee      hearing, NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers stated that sharing      threat indicators without filtering out personal data would      slow operations and negatively impact NSA's cyber defense      activities. Further, in the wake of revelations regarding the      PRISM program, major tech companies stated that they would      not voluntarily share users' information with the NSA.      Automated NSA access could thus disincentivize sharing,      undercutting the key goal of the legislation.       Inadequate Protections Prior to Sharing: CISA does not      effectively require private entities to strip out information      that identifies a specific person prior to sharing cyber      threat indicators with the government, a fundamental and      important privacy protection. While the bill requires that      companies ``review'' cyber threat indicators for information      that identifies a specific person and sometimes remove it,      the bill contains no standard to ensure that this review      effort is--at a minimum--reasonable.       Further, the bill requires companies to remove that      information only for individuals that it knows are ``not      directly related to a cybersecurity threat.'' This could      encourage companies to retain data by default, unnecessarily      exposing the information of innocent bystanders and victims      to the government, and making it available to law enforcement      for a myriad of investigative uses. Legislation should      instead require that prior to sharing, companies make at      least a reasonable effort to identify all personally      identifiable information and, unless it is necessary to      counter the cyber threat before sharing any indicators with      the government, remove it. The default should be to preserve      privacy, rather than to sacrifice it.       Dangerous Authorization for Countermeasures: CISA      authorizes countermeasures ``notwithstanding any law,''      including the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. As      amended by CISA, federal law would permit companies to      retaliate against a perceived threat in a manner that may      cause significant harm, and undermine cybersecurity. CISA      provides that countermeasures must be ``operated on'' one's      own information systems, but may have off-networks effects--     including harmful effects to external systems--so long as the      countermeasures do not ``intentionally'' destroy other      entities' systems. Given the risks of misattribution and      escalation posed by offensive cyber activities--as well as      the potential for misappropriation--this is highly      inadvisable. CISA permits companies to recklessly deploy      countermeasures that damage networks belonging to innocent      bystanders, such as a hospital or emergency responders that      attackers use as proxies to hide behind, so long as the      deploying company does not intend that the countermeasure      result in harm. CISA's authorization would not only      inadvisably wipe away the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's      current prohibition against these activities, it would be      dangerous to internet security.       Overbroad Law Enforcement Use: Law enforcement use of      information shared for cybersecurity purposes should be      limited to prosecuting specific cyber crimes identified in      the bill and preventing imminent loss of life or serious      bodily harm. CISA goes far beyond this, and permits law      enforcement to use information it receives for investigations      and prosecutions of a wide range of crimes involving any      level of physical force, including those that involve no      threat of death or significant bodily harm, as well as for      terrorism investigations, which have served as the basis for      overbroad collection programs, and any alleged violations of      various provisions of the Espionage Act. The lack of use      limitations creates yet another loophole for law enforcement      to conduct backdoor searches on Americans--including searches      of digital communications that would otherwise require law      enforcement to obtain a warrant based on probable cause. This      undermines Fourth Amendment protections and constitutional      principles.       Cybersecurity legislation should be designed to increase      digital hygiene and identify and remediate advanced threats,      not create surveillance authorities that would compromise      essential privacy rights, and undermine security.      Accordingly, we urge that the Committee not approve this bill      without addressing these concerns.

        "statement": "The RESTORE Act extends the ability of the Government to acquire communications of persons abroad for the purpose of terrorism and other national security threats. Earlier this year, in the Protect America Act, PAA, amendments were made to the long-standing consensus approach set forth in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA. Responding to what the administration characterized as pressing concerns, the PAA gave the Government enhanced flexibility to collect foreign intelligence information. But the broad scope of the authority and procedures that allowed the Government to collect this information without up-front court approval raised grave concerns about the need for more safeguards of innocent Americans' communications. The RESTORE Act improves upon the PAA by providing a series of checks and balances while still allowing maximum flexibility. It limits the Government's authority to what the Director of National Intelligence told us he needed--a means to acquire information from telecommunications companies about physical threats to the Nation in which the target is overseas. The RESTORE Act does not require individual warrants when persons reasonably believed to be abroad, but it is firm that a FISA warrant is required to obtain communications of people in the United States. The RESTORE Act settles that FISA is the exclusive means of electronic surveillance, and that no modifications can be made without express statutory authorization. The RESTORE Act will also provide additional resources for the National Security Agency and Department of Justice to ensure that there are no backlogs of critical intelligence gathering.",

        "statement": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fort George G. Meade. For a century, Fort Meade has been an integral part of both our national security system as well as the Maryland community.   First constructed to house troops shipping off to fight in World War I, Camp Meade--as it was then known--was named for Civil War hero Major General George Gordon Meade, whose victory at the Battle of Gettysburg halted the Confederacy's invasion of the Union and turned the tide of the war. Over the course of World War I, more than 400,000 service members left from Camp Meade to fight in the war.   During the interwar period, Fort Meade housed the Army Tank School as well as the Experimental Motorized Forces. During World War II, approximately 3.5 million soldiers trained at Fort Meade, which was also used to house Italian and German prisoners of war.   After WWII, the Fort reverted to peacetime activities. The Fort's importance grew when the Second U.S. Army moved to Fort Meade, and again when the First U.S. Army merged with the Second and moved to Fort Meade. In 1953, the Fort became the first to deploy the Nike I antiaircraft missile system. Later renamed the Nike Ajax, the Nike I was the world's first surface-to-air missile defense system and was designed to protect the capital region from Soviet bombers.   The Cold War period initiated a shift at the base to a greater intelligence focus. Fort Meade has been vital to the intelligence mission of the United States since the 1950s, when it became the headquarters for the National Security Agency (NSA). The Fort's mission expanded in 1995 when the Defense Information School moved there. Since that time the School has expanded to include both the Defense Visual Information School and the Defense Photography School. More recently US Cyber Command was moved to Fort Meade. Today, six cyber headquarters are housed at Fort Meade, making it the epicenter of our 21st century defense.   The 2005 BRAC ushered in some of the most significant growth in the history of the Fort. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), which provides complete information technology services to the Department of Defense, moved its headquarters to Fort Meade, bringing 4,300 workers to a new 1.1 million-square-foot headquarters. The Defense Media Activity and Defense Adjudication Activities also relocated to the base, bringing a combined total of over 1,300 positions employees with them. The continued growth of Fort Meade during a time of downsizing and shrinking budgets speaks to its efficacy and its essential mission.   The NSA presence at Fort Meade makes the base one of the most important to the security of our nation. The work done by thousands of Marylanders at the Fort every day is crucial for maintaining day to day IT stability for all Americans and disrupting terrorist networks and plans. In addition to its vital impact on our nation's intelligence mission, Fort Meade has sent many active duty service members abroad. Collectively, around 2,700 personnel from 42 units were deployed from the base during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.   I also want to emphasize the enormous impact Fort George G. Meade has on the economy of our state. Fort Meade employs over 56,000 personnel across 119 agencies and has a supported population of over 145,000, providing a significant boost to the local economy. Fort George G. Meade is the largest employer in Maryland, the fifth-largest employment center in the state, and has the third-largest workforce of any U.S. Army installation.   In the past 100 years, Fort Meade has made a profound impact on Maryland, the United States, and the world. I am confident that legacy will continue over the next 100 years and beyond, and once again congratulate Fort George G. Meade and all who have served there on this momentous anniversary.",

Bush, in violation of his constitutional oath to      faithfully execute the office of President of the United      States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect,      and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in      violation of his constitutional duty under Article II,      Section 3 of the Constitution ``to take care that the laws be      faithfully executed,'' has both personally and acting through      his agents and      subordinates, knowingly violated the fourth Amendment to the      Constitution and the Foreign Intelligence Service Act of 1978      (FISA) by authorizing warrantless electronic surveillance of      American citizens to wit:       (1) The President was aware of the FISA Law requiring a      court order for any wiretap as evidenced by the following:       (A) ``Now, by the way, any time you hear the United States      government talking about wiretap, it requires--a wiretap      requires a court order. Nothing has changed, by the way. When      we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking      about getting a court order before we do so.'' White House      Press conference on April 20, 2004. [White House Transcript]       (B) ``Law enforcement officers need a federal judge's      permission to wiretap a foreign terrorist's phone, or to      track his calls, or to search his property. Officers must      meet strict standards to use any of the tools we're talking      about.'' President Bush's speech in Baltimore Maryland on      July 20th 2005. [White House Transcript]       (2) The President repeatedly ordered the NSA to place      wiretaps on American citizens without requesting a warrant      from FISA as evidenced by the following:       (A) ``Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush      secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop      on Americans and others inside the United States to search      for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved      warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according      to government officials.'' New York Times article by James      Risen and Eric Lichtblau on December 12, 2005. [NYTimes]       (B) The President admits to authorizing the program by      stating ``I have reauthorized this program more than 30 times      since the September the 11th attacks, and I intend to do so      for as long as our nation faces a continuing threat from al      Qaeda and related groups. The NSA's activities under this      authorization are thoroughly reviewed by the Justice      Department and NSA's top legal officials, including NSA's      general counsel and inspector general. Leaders in Congress      have been briefed more than a dozen times on this      authorization and the activities conducted under it.'' Radio      Address from the White House on December 17, 2005. [White      House Transcript]       (C) In a December 19th 2005 press conference the President      publicly admitted to using a combination of surveillance      techniques including some with permission from the FISA      courts and some without permission from FISA.       Reporter: It was, why did you skip the basic safeguards of      asking courts for permission for the intercepts?       The President: . . . We use FISA still--you're referring to      the FISA court in your question--of course, we use FISAs. But      FISA is for long-term monitoring. What is needed in order to      protect the American people is the ability to move quickly to      detect. Now, having suggested this idea, I then, obviously,      went to the question, is it legal to do so? I am--I swore to      uphold the laws. Do I have the legal authority to do this?      And the answer is, absolutely. As I mentioned in my remarks,      the legal authority is derived from the Constitution, as well      as the authorization of force by the United States      Congress.'' [White House Transcript]       (D) Mike McConnel, the Director of National Intelligence,      in a letter to to Senator Arlen Specter, acknowledged that      Bush's Executive Order in 2001 authorized a series of secret      surveillance activities and included undisclosed activities      beyond the warrantless surveillance of e-mails and phone      calls that Bush confirmed in December 2005. ``NSA Spying Part      of Broader Effort'' by Dan Eggen, Washington Post, 8/1/07.       (3) The President ordered the surveillance to be conducted      in a way that would spy upon private communications between      American citizens located within the United States borders as      evidenced by the following:       (A) Mark Klein, a retired AT communications technician,      submitted an affidavit in support of the Electronic Frontier      Foundation's FF's lawsuit against AT He testified that in      2003 he connected a ``splitter'' that sent a copy of Internet      traffic and phone calls to a secure room that was operated by      the NSA in the San Francisco office of AT He heard from a      co-worker that similar rooms were being constructed in other      cities, including Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles and San      Diego. From ``Whistle-Blower Outs NSA Spy Room,'' Wired News,      4/7/06 [Wired] [EFF Case]       (4) The President asserted an inherent authority to conduct      electronic surveillance based on the Constitution and the      ``Authorization to use Military Force in Iraq'' (AUMF) that      was not legally valid as evidenced by the following:       (A) In a December 19th, 2005 Press Briefing General Alberto      Gonzales admitted that the surveillance authorized by the      President was not only done without FISA warrants, but that      the nature of the surveillance was so far removed from what      FISA can approve that FISA could not even be amended to allow      it. Gonzales stated ``We have had discussions with Congress      in the past--certain members of Congress--as to whether or      not FISA could be amended to allow us to adequately deal with      this kind of threat, and we were advised that that would be      difficult, if not impossible.''.       (B) The fourth amendment to the United States Constitution      states ``The right of the people to be secure in their      persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable      searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants      shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or      affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be      searched, and the persons or things to be seized.''       (C) ``The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978      unambiguously limits warrantless domestic electronic      surveillance, even in a congressionally declared war, to the      first 15 days of that war; criminalizes any such electronic      surveillance not authorized by statute; and expressly      establishes FISA and two chapters of the federal criminal      code, governing wiretaps for intelligence purposes and for      criminal investigation, respectively, as the ``exclusive      means by which electronic surveillance . . . and the      interception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic      communications may be conducted.'' 50 U.S.C. 1811, 1809, 18      U.S.C. 2511(2)(f).'' Letter from Harvard Law Professor      Lawrence Tribe to John Conyers on 1/6/06.       (D) In a December 19th, 2005 Press Briefing Attorney      General Alberto Gonzales stated ``Our position is, is that      the authorization to use force, which was passed by the      Congress in the days following September 11th, constitutes      that other authorization, that other statute by Congress, to      engage in this kind of signals intelligence.''       (E) The ``Authorization to use Military Force in Iraq''      does not give any explicit authorization related to      electronic surveillance. [HJRes114]       (F) ``From the foregoing analysis, it appears unlikely that      a court would hold that Congress has expressly or impliedly      authorized the NSA electronic surveillance operations here      under discussion, and it would likewise appear that, to the      extent that those surveillances fall within the definition of      ``electronic surveillance'' within the meaning of FISA or any      activity regulated under Title III, Congress intended to      cover the entire field with these statutes.'' From the      ``Presidential Authority to Conduct Warrantless Electronic      Surveillance to Gather Foreign Intelligence Information'' by      the Congressional Research Service on January 5, 2006.       (G) ``The inescapable conclusion is that the AUMF did not      implicitly authorize what the FISA expressly prohibited. It      follows that the presidential program of surveillance at      issue here is a violation of the separation of powers--as      grave an abuse of executive authority as I can recall ever      having studied.'' Letter from Harvard Law Professor Lawrence      Tribe to John Conyers on 1/6/06.       (H) On August 17, 2006 Judge Anna Diggs Taylor of the      United States District Court in Detroit, in ACLU v. NSA,      ruled that the ``NSA program to wiretap the international      communications of some Americans without a court warrant      violated the Constitution. . . . Judge Taylor ruled that the      program violated both the Fourth Amendment and a 1978 law      that requires warrants from a secret court for intelligence      wiretaps involving people in the United States. She rejected      the administration's repeated assertions that a 2001      Congressional authorization and the president's      constitutional authority allowed the program.'' From a New      York Times article ``Judge Finds Wiretap Actions Violate the      Law'' 8/18/06 and the Memorandum Opinion.       (I) In July 2007, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals      dismissed the case, ruling the plaintiffs had no standing to      sue because, given the secretive nature of the surveillance,      they could not state with certainty that they have been      wiretapped by the NSA. This ruling did not address the      legality of the surveillance so Judge Taylor's decision is      the only ruling on that issue. [ACLU Legal Documents]       In all of these actions and decisions, President George W.      Bush has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President      and Commander in Chief, and subversive of constitutional      government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice      and to the manifest injury of the people of the United      States. Wherefore, President George W. Bush, by such conduct,      is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from      office.",

        "statement": "Dear Colleagues: The FISA Amendments Act, S. 2248, provides      limited and narrowly-drawn retroactive civil liability      protection to those telecommunication companies that      allegedly assisted the government with the President's      Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP). An amendment has been      offered to this Act to strike these liability protections in      favor of ``substitution,'' a legal mechanism for replacing      the companies in the ongoing TSP litigation with the      government.       The Senate Intelligence Committee conducted a comprehensive      and bipartisan review of the President's TSP, including the      issue of carrier liability. The Committee reviewed numerous      documents, including the Department of Justice legal opinions      and the letters from the government to the companies. The      Committee held a number of briefings and hearings involving      government and company officials. The Committee also visited      the National Security Agency to see firsthand how the TSP      worked.       As a result of this extensive review, the Committee      concluded that, irrespective of one's opinion of the      President's reliance on Article II authority to justify the      TSP, those companies that assisted with the TSP did so in      good faith and based upon the written representations from      the highest levels of government that the program was lawful.       The Committee's bill, reported out on a strong, bipartisan      vote of 13-2, reflects our determination that companies that      cooperated with the government in good faith should be      protected from time-consuming and expensive litigation. It is      a matter of fundamental fairness. The Committee rejected the      broad immunity proposal sought by the Administration. Our      limited immunity provision only covers assistance provided      from September 11th to when the TSP was put under court      authorization in January of last year. It does not provide      protection from criminal prosecution or extend protections to      government officials. Any litigation against government      officials will continue.       In concluding that civil liability protection for those      companies was appropriate, the Committee recognized that      allowing the current litigation to continue could: (1)      compromise our intelligence sources and methods through      ongoing discovery and other litigation proceedings; (2)      result in significant loss of business reputation or      financial loss for those companies that participated in good      faith; (3) jeopardize the personal safety of overseas      employees of these companies if it becomes known that the      companies assisted the government in fighting terrorism; (4)      put taxpayers' dollars at risk for dubious legal claims; and      (5) lead to reluctance by these and other companies to      cooperate with legitimate requests for assistance in the      future.       The substitution amendment sponsored by Senators Specter      and Whitehouse does not alleviate any of these concerns. Even      if the companies are removed directly from the litigation,      discovery would still be allowed to proceed against them. In      short, the conduct of the companies would continue to be      litigated, raising significant concerns that their identities      or details about their assistance will be disclosed. Given      the essential role that our private partners play in      intelligence collection, we believe that this is simply too      great a risk to our national security.       We believe, therefore, that the ongoing litigation against      the telecommunication companies should be brought to an      immediate close and that the Intelligence Committee's      bipartisan determination of good faith should stand. We urge      you to support the Intelligence Committee's bill and oppose      any effort to modify or strike its civil liability provision.           Sincerely,     John D. Rockefeller IV,       Chairman.     Christopher S. Bond,       Vice Chairman.",

        "statement": "Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,      President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to      target al Qaeda communications into and out of the country.      Mr. Bush concluded that this was essential for protecting the      country, that using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act      would not permit the necessary speed and agility, and that he      had the constitutional power to authorize such surveillance      without court orders to defend the country.       Since the program became public in 2006, Congress has been      asserting appropriate oversight. Few of those who learned the      details of the program have criticized its necessity.      Instead, critics argued that if the president found FISA      inadequate, he should have gone to Congress and gotten the      changes necessary to allow the program to proceed under court      orders. That process is now underway. The administration has      brought the program under FISA, and the Senate Intelligence      Committee recently reported out a bill with a strong      bipartisan majority of 13-2, that would make the changes to      FISA needed for the program to continue. This bill is now      being considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.       Public disclosure of the NSA program also brought a flood      of class-action lawsuits seeking to impose massive liability      on phone companies for allegedly answering the government's      call for help. The Intelligence Committee has reviewed the      program and has concluded that the companies deserve targeted      protection from these suits. The protection would extend only      to activities      undertaken after 9/11 until the beginning of 2007, authorized      by the president to defend the country from further terrorist      attack, and pursuant to written assurances from the      government that the activities were both authorized by the      president and legal.       We agree with the committee. Dragging phone companies      through protracted litigation would not only be unfair, but      it would deter other companies and private citizens from      responding in terrorist emergencies whenever there may be      uncertainty or legal risk.       The government alone cannot protect us from the threats we      face today. We must have the help of all our citizens. There      will be times when the lives of thousands of Americans will      depend on whether corporations such as airlines or banks are      willing to lend assistance. If we do not treat companies      fairly when they respond to assurances from the highest      levels of the government that their help is legal and      essential for saving lives, then we will be radically      reducing our society's capacity to defend itself.       This concern is particularly acute for our nation's      telecommunications companies. America's front line of defense      against terrorist attack is communications intelligence.      When Americans put their loved ones on planes, send their      children to school, or ride through tunnels and over      bridges, they are counting on the ``early warning'' system      of communications intelligence for their safety.      Communications technology has become so complex that our      country needs the voluntary cooperation of the companies.      Without it, our intelligence efforts will be gravely      damaged.       Whether the government has acted properly is a different      question from whether a private person has acted properly in      responding to the government's call for help. From its      earliest days, the common law recognized that when a public      official calls on a citizen to help protect the community in      an emergency, the person has a duty to help and should be      immune from being hauled into court unless it was clear      beyond doubt that the public official was acting illegally.      Because a private person cannot have all the information      necessary to assess the propriety of the government's      actions, he must be able to rely on official assurances about      need and legality. Immunity is designed to avoid the burden      of protracted litigation, because the prospect of such      litigation itself is enough to deter citizens from providing      critically needed assistance.       As the Intelligence Committee found, the companies clearly      acted in ``good faith.'' The situation is one in which      immunity has traditionally been applied, and thus protection      from this litigation is justified.       First, the circumstances clearly showed that there was a      bona fide threat to ``national security.'' We had suffered      the most devastating attacks in our history, and Congress had      declared the attacks ``continue to pose an unusual and      extraordinary threat'' to the country. It would have been      entirely reasonable for the companies to credit government      representations that the nation faced grave and immediate      threat and that their help was needed to protect American      lives.       Second, the bill's protections only apply if assistance was      given in response to the president's personal authorization,      communicated in writing along with assurances of legality.      That is more than is required by FISA, which contains a safe-     harbor authorizing assistance based solely on a certification      by the attorney general, his designee, or a host of more      junior law enforcement officials that no warrant is required.       Third, the ultimate legal issue--whether the president was      acting within his constitutional powers--is not the kind of      question a private party can definitively determine. The      companies were not in a position to say that the government      was definitely wrong.       Prior to FISA's 1978 enactment, numerous federal courts      took it for granted that the president has constitutional      power to conduct warrantless surveillance to protect the      nation's security. In 2002, the FISA Court of Review, while      not dealing directly with the NSA program, stated that FISA      could not limit the president's constitutional powers. Given      this, it cannot be said that the companies acted in bad faith      in relying on the government's assurances of legality.       For hundreds of years our legal system has operated under      the premise that, in a public emergency, we want private      citizens to respond to the government's call for help unless      the citizen knows for sure that the government is acting      illegally. If Congress does not act now, it would be      basically saying that private citizens should only help when      they are absolutely certain that all the government's actions      are legal. Given the threats we face in today's world, this      would be a perilous policy.",

In In re National Security Agency Telecommunications Records Litigation, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker in the Northern District of California considered a case brought by an Islamic charity that claims to have been a subject of the surveillance program. In a 56-page opinion he held that Congress's enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, FISA, had constrained the President's inherent authority--if any--to conduct warrantless wiretapping: ``Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence surveillance activities to be conducted. Whatever power the executive may otherwise have had in this regard, FISA limits the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities.'' Nevertheless, this finding is preliminary.",

        "statement": "We, the undersigned, having undertaken an independent      investigation of Israel's attack on the USS Liberty,      including eyewitness testimony from surviving crewmembers, a      review of naval and other official records, an examination of      official statements by the Israeli and American governments,      a study of the conclusions of all previous official      inquiries, and a consideration of important      new evidence and recent statements from individuals having      direct knowledge of the attack or the cover up, hereby find      the following:       1. That on June 8, 1967, after eight hours of aerial      surveillance, Israel launched a two-hour air and naval attack      against the USS Liberty, the world's most sophisticated      intelligence ship, inflicting 34 dead and 172 wounded      American servicemen (a casualty rate of seventy percent, in a      crew of 294);       2. That the Israeli air attack lasted approximately 25      minutes, during which time unmarked Israeli aircraft dropped      napalm canisters on the Liberty's bridge, and fired 30mm      cannons and rockets into our ship, causing 821 holes, more      than 100 of which were rocket-size; survivors estimate 30 or      more sorties were flown over the ship by a minimum of 12      attacking Israeli planes which were jamming all five American      emergency radio channels;       3. That the torpedo boat attack involved not only the      firing of torpedoes, but the machine-gunning of the Liberty's      firefighters and stretcher-bearers as they struggled to save      their ship and crew; the Israeli torpedo boats later returned      to machine-gun at close range three of the Liberty's life      rafts that had been lowered into the water by survivors to      rescue the most seriously wounded;       4. That there is compelling evidence that Israel's attack      was a deliberate attempt to destroy an American ship and kill      her entire crew; evidence of such intent is supported by      statements from Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Undersecretary      of State George Ball, former CIA director Richard Helms,      former NSA directors Lieutenant General William Odom, USA      (Ret.), Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, USN (Ret.), and Marshal      Carter; former NSA deputy directors Oliver Kirby and Major      General John Morrison, USAF (Ret.); and former Ambassador      Dwight Porter, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon in 1967;       5. That in attacking the USS Liberty, Israel committed acts      of murder against American servicemen and an act of war      against the United States;       6. That fearing conflict with Israel, the White House      deliberately prevented the U.S. Navy from coming to the      defense of the Liberty by recalling Sixth Fleet military      rescue support while the ship was under attack; evidence of      the recall of rescue aircraft is supported by statements of      Captain Joe Tully, Commanding Officer of the aircraft carrier      USS Saratoga, and Rear Admiral Lawrence Geis, the Sixth Fleet      carrier division commander, at the time of the attack; never      before in American naval history has a rescue mission been      cancelled when an American ship was under attack;       7. That although the Liberty was saved from almost certain      destruction through the heroic efforts of the ship's Captain,      William L. McGonagle (MOH), and his brave crew, surviving      crewmembers were later threatened with ``court-martial,      imprisonment or worse'' if they exposed the truth; and were      abandoned by their own government;       8. That due to the influence of Israel's powerful      supporters in the United States, the White House deliberately      covered up the facts of this attack from the American people;       9. That due to continuing pressure by the pro-Israel lobby      in the United States, this attack remains the only serious      naval incident that has never been thoroughly investigated by      Congress; to this day, no surviving crewmember has been      permitted to officially and publicly testify about the      attack;       10. That there has been an official cover-up without      precedent in American naval history; the existence of such a      cover-up is now supported by statements of Rear Admiral      Merlin Staring, USN (Ret.), former Judge Advocate General of      the Navy; and Captain Ward Boston, USN, (Ret.), the chief      counsel to the Navy's 1967 Court of Inquiry of the Liberty      attack;       11. That the truth about Israel's attack and subsequent      White House cover-up continues to be officially concealed      from the American people to the present day and is a national      disgrace;       12. That a danger to our national security exists whenever      our elected officials are willing to subordinate American      interests to those of any foreign nation, and specifically      are unwilling to challenge Israel's interests when they      conflict with American interests; this policy, evidenced by      the failure to defend the USS Liberty and the subsequent      official cover-up of the Israeli attack, endangers the safety      of Americans and the security of the United States.       Whereupon, we, the undersigned, in order to fulfill our      duty to the brave crew of the USS Liberty and to all      Americans who are asked to serve in our Armed Forces, hereby      call upon the Department of the Navy, the Congress of the      United States and the American people to immediately take the      following actions:       First, That a new Court of Inquiry be convened by the      Department of the Navy, operating with Congressional      oversight, to take public testimony from surviving      crewmembers; and to thoroughly investigate the circumstances      of the attack on the USS Liberty, with full cooperation from      the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency      and the military intelligence services, and to determine      Israel's possible motive in launching said attack on a U.S.      naval vessel;       Second, That every appropriate committee of the Congress of      the United States investigate the actions of the White House      and Defense Department that prevented the rescue of the USS      Liberty, thereafter threatened her surviving officers and men      if they exposed the truth, and covered up the true      circumstances of the attack from the American people; and       Third, That the eighth day of June of every year be      proclaimed to be hereafter known as USS Liberty Remembrance      Day, in order to commemorate the Liberty's heroic crew; and      to educate the American people of the danger to our national      security inherent in any passionate attachment of our elected      officials for any foreign nation.",

        "statement": "Section 303's amendments to section 20 of the NIST Act, 15 U.S.C. 278g-3, are modified in several respects. First, NIST guidance concerning the identification of national security systems, at subsection (b)(3), is to be developed in conjunction with the Department of Defense, including the National Security Agency. Second, as requested by the Administration and the Science Committee, subsections (c)(5), (6), and (7) are modified to be ``to the maximum extent practicable.'' These changes are intended to preserve the policy of reliance on flexible, performance-based, technology-neutral requirements, while recognizing that there likely will be times where needs such as interoperability or the reality of market predominance will require guidance that addresses specific technologies or products. Third, as requested by the Science Committee, the bill drops subsection (d), which would have established a NIST Office for Information Security Programs. Finally, also at the request of the Science Committee, subsection (e) is revised consistent with current law to provide for NIST technical assistance to agencies, at (e)(2), and to authorize NIST to help the private sector, upon request, with NIST guidance and other assistance, at (e)(6).",

        "statement": "Moreover, Mr. Speaker, it is important to point out that the loudest demands for blanket immunity comes not from the telecommunications companies but from the Administration, which raises the interesting question of whether the Administration's real motivation is to shield from public disclosure the ways and means by which government officials may have ``persuaded'' telecommunications companies to assist in its warrantless surveillance programs. I call my colleagues' attention to an article published in the Washington Post last Sunday, in which it is reported that Joseph Nacchio, the former CEO of Qwest, alleges that his company was denied NSA contracts after he declined in a February 27, 2001 meeting at Fort Meade with National Security Agency (NSA) representatives to give the NSA customer calling records.",

The revelation and subsequent declassification of the National Security Agency's intelligence gathering programs have shocked Americans in ways that I long ago had telegraphed. We are having a spirited and critical debate about what the right balance between privacy and security ought to be. With regards to NSA activity, I am introducing bipartisan legislation today, with several senators of both parties, designed to narrow Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, known also as the ``business records'' provision, to better balance the authorities we give the federal government while protecting our constitutional rights. More specifically, my legislation would prevent the federal government from collecting millions of law-abiding Americans' phone call records without first establishing some nexus to terrorism. We all expect the NSA to target terrorists, but the revelations in the past few weeks have made clear that the information of millions of law-abiding Americans is being swept up in the process.",

The committee has identified a few areas that we think are priorities that need additional attention. One area of particular concern is the need to recapitalize the National Security Agency to assure our ability to collect signals intelligence. Collecting and deciphering the communications of America's adversaries provides senior policymakers with a unique source of sensitive information. In 1998, and again this year, the committee asked a group of highly qualified technical experts to review NSA operations. The Technical Advisory Group's conclusions were unsettling. They identified significant shortcomings which have resulted from the sustained budget decline of the past decade. With limited available resources the NSA has maintained its day-to-day readiness but has not invested in needed modernization. Consequently, NSA's technological infrastructure and human resources are struggling to meet emerging challenges.",

        "statement": "``There is no evidence that Saddam Hussein was connected in      any way to al Qaeda.''       So declared CNN Anchor Carol Costello in an interview      yesterday with Representative Robin Hayes (no relation) from      North Carolina.       Hayes politely challenged her claim. ``Ma'am, I'm sorry,      but you're mistaken. There's evidence everywhere. We get      access to it. Unfortunately, others don't.''       CNN played the exchange throughout the day. At one point,      anchor Daryn Kagan even seemed to correct Rep. Hayes after      replaying the clip. ``And according to the record, the 9/11      Commission in its final report found no connection between al      Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.''       The CNN claims are wrong. Not a matter of nuance. Not a      matter of interpretation. Just plain incorrect. They are so      mistaken, in fact, that viewers should demand an on-air      correction.       But such claims are, sadly, representative of the broad      media misunderstanding of the relationship between Iraq and      al Qaeda. Richard Cohen, columnist for the Washington Post,      regularly chides the Bush administration for presenting what      he calls fabricated or ``fictive'' links between Iraq and al      Qaeda. The editor of the Los Angeles Times scolded the Bush      administration for perpetuating the ``myth'' of such links.      ``Sixty Minutes'' anchor Lesley Stahl put it bluntly: ``There      was no connection.''       Conveniently, such analyses ignore statements like this one      from Thomas Kean, chairman of the 9/11 Commission. ``There      was no question in our minds that there was a relationship      between Iraq and al Qaeda.'' Hard to believe reporters just      missed it--he made the comments at the press conference held      to release the commission's final report. And that report      detailed several ``friendly contacts'' between Iraq and al      Qaeda, and concluded only that there was no proof of Iraqi      involvement in al Qaeda terrorist attacks against American      interests. Details, details.       There have been several recent developments. One month ago,      Jordan's King Abdullah explained to the Arabic-language      newspaper al Hayat that his government had tried before the      Iraq war to extradite Abu Musab al Zarqawi from Iraq. ``We      had information that he entered Iraq from a neighboring      country, where he lived and what he was doing. We informed      the Iraqi authorities about all this detailed information we      had, but they didn't respond.'' He added:       ``Since Zarqawi entered Iraq before the fall of the former      regime we have been trying to have him deported back to      Jordan for trial, but our efforts were in vain.''       One week later, former Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi      told the same newspaper that the new Iraqi government is in      possession of documents showing that Ayman al Zawahiri, bin      Laden's top deputy, and Zarqawi both entered Iraq in      September 1999. (If the documents are authentic, they suggest      that Zarqawi may have plotted the Jordanian Millennium      attacks from Iraq.)       Beyond what people are saying about the Iraq-al Qaeda      connection, there is the evidence. In 1992 the Iraqi      Intelligence services compiled a list of its assets. On page      14 of the document, marked ``Top Secret'' and dated March 28,      1992, is the name of Osama bin Laden, who is reported to have      a ``good relationship'' with the Iraqi intelligence section      in Syria. The Defense Intelligence Agency has possession of      the document and has assessed that it is accurate. In 1993,      Saddam Hussein and bin Laden reached an ``understanding''      that Islamic radicals would refrain from attacking the Iraqi      regime in exchange for unspecified assistance, including      weapons development. This understanding, which was included      in the Clinton administration's indictment of bin Laden in      the spring of 1998, has been corroborated by numerous Iraqis      and al Qaeda terrorists now in U.S. custody. In 1994, Faruq      Hijazi, then deputy director of Iraqi Intelligence, met face-     to-face with bin Laden. Bin Laden requested anti-ship limpet      mines and training camps in Iraq. Hijazi has detailed the      meeting in a custodial interview with U.S. interrogators. In      1995, according to internal Iraqi intelligence documents      first reported by the New York Times on June 25, 2004, a      ``former director of operations for Iraqi Intelligence      Directorate 4 met with Mr. bin Laden on Feb. 19.'' When bin      Laden left Sudan in 1996, the document states, Iraqi      intelligence sough ``other channels through which to handle      the relationship, in light of his current location.'' That      same year, Hussein agreed to a request from bin Laden to      broadcast anti-Saudi propaganda on Iraqi state television. In      1997, al Qaeda sent an emissary with the nom de guerre      Abdullah al Iraqi to Iraq for training on weapons of mass      destruction. Colin Powell cited this evidence in his      presentation at the UN on February 5, 2003. The Senate      Intelligence Committee has concluded that Powell's      presentation on Iraq and terrorism was ``reasonable.''       In 1998, according to documents unearthed in Iraq's      Intelligence headquarters in April 2003, al Qaeda sent a      ``trusted confidante'' of bin Laden to Baghdad for 16 days of      meetings beginning March 5. Iraqi intelligence paid for his      stay in Room 414 of the Mansur al Melia hotel and expressed      hope that the envoy would serve as the liaison between Iraqi      intelligence and bin Laden. The DIA has assessed those      documents as authentic. In 1999, a CIA Counterterrorism      Center analysis reported on April 13 that four intelligence      reports indicate Saddam Hussein has given bin Laden a      standing offer of safe haven in Iraq. The CTC report is      included in the Senate Intelligence Committee's review on      prewar intelligence.       In 2000, Saudi Arabia went on kingdom-wide alert after      learning that Iraq had agreed to help al Qaeda attack U.S.      and British interests on the peninsula. In 2001, satellite      images show large numbers of al Qaeda terrorists displaced      after the war in Afghanistan relocating to camps in northern      Iraq financed, in part, by the Hussein regime. In 2002, a      report from the National Security Agency in October reveals      that Iraq agreed to provide safe haven, financing and weapons      to al Qaeda members relocating in northern Iraq. In 2003, on      February 14, the Philippine      government ousted Hisham Hussein, the second secretary of the      Iraqi embassy in Manila, for his involvement in al Qaeda-     related terrorist activities. Andrea Domingo, head of      Immigration for the Philippine government, told reporters      that ``studying the movements and activities'' of Iraqi      intelligence assets in the country, including radical      Islamists, revealed an ``established network'' of terrorists      headed by Hussein.       Can CNN stand by its claim that ``there is no evidence that      Saddam Hussein was connected in any way to al Qaeda?''",

        "statement": "Washington, Oct. 3.--When the Justice Department publicly      declared torture ``abhorrent'' in a legal opinion in December      2004, the Bush administration appeared to have abandoned its      assertion of nearly unlimited presidential authority to order      brutal interrogations.       But soon after Alberto R. Gonzales's arrival as attorney      general in February 2005, the Justice Department issued      another opinion, this one in secret. It was a very different      document, according to officials briefed on it, an expansive      endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever      used by the Central Intelligence Agency.       The new opinion, the officials said, for the first time      provided explicit authorization to barrage terror suspects      with a combination of painful physical and psychological      tactics, including head-slapping, simulated drowning and      frigid temperatures.       Mr. Gonzales approved the legal memorandum on ``combined      effects'' over the objections of James B. Comey, the deputy      attorney general, who was leaving his job after bruising      clashes with the White House. Disagreeing with what he viewed      as the opinion's overreaching legal reasoning, Mr. Comey told      colleagues at the department that they would all be      ``ashamed'' when the world eventually learned of it.       Later that year, as Congress moved toward outlawing      ``cruel, inhuman and degrading'' treatment, the Justice      Department issued another secret opinion, one most lawmakers      did not know existed, current and former officials said. The      Justice Department document declared that none of the C.I.A.      interrogation methods violated that standard.       The classified opinions, never previously disclosed, are a      hidden legacy of President Bush's second term and Mr.      Gonzales's tenure at the Justice Department, where he moved      quickly to align it with the White House after a 2004      rebellion by staff lawyers that had thrown policies on      surveillance and detention into turmoil.       Congress and the Supreme Court have intervened repeatedly      in the last two years to impose limits on interrogations, and      the administration has responded as a policy matter by      dropping the most extreme techniques. But the 2005 Justice      Department opinions remain in effect, and their legal      conclusions have been confirmed by several more recent      memorandums, officials said. They show how the White House      has succeeded in preserving the broadest possible legal      latitude for harsh tactics.       A White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Wednesday that      he would not comment on any legal opinion related to      interrogations. Mr. Fratto added, ``We have gone to great      lengths, including statutory efforts and the recent executive      order, to make it clear that the intelligence community and      our practices fall within U.S. law'' and international      agreements.       More than two dozen current and former officials involved      in counterterrorism were interviewed over the past three      months about the opinions and the deliberations on      interrogation policy. Most officials would speak only on the      condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of the      documents and the C.I.A. detention operations they govern.       When he stepped down as attorney general in September after      widespread criticism of the firing of federal prosecutors and      withering attacks on his credibility, Mr. Gonzales talked      proudly in a farewell speech of how his department was ``a      place of inspiration'' that had balanced the necessary      flexibility to conduct the war on terrorism with the need to      uphold the law.       Associates at the Justice Department said Mr. Gonzales      seldom resisted pressure from Vice President Dick Cheney and      David S. Addington, Mr. Cheney's counsel, to endorse policies      that they saw as effective in safeguarding Americans, even      though the practices brought the condemnation of other      governments, human rights groups and Democrats in Congress.      Critics say Mr. Gonzales turned his agency into an arm of the      Bush      White House, undermining the department's independence.       The interrogation opinions were signed by Steven G.      Bradbury, who since 2005 has headed the elite Office of Legal      Counsel at the Justice Department. He has become a frequent      public defender of the National Security Agency's domestic      surveillance program and detention policies at Congressional      hearings and press briefings, a role that some legal scholars      say is at odds with the office's tradition of avoiding      political advocacy.       Mr. Bradbury defended the work of his office as the      government's most authoritative interpreter of the law. ``In      my experience, the White House has not told me how an opinion      should come out,'' he said in an interview. ``The White House      has accepted and respected our opinions, even when they      didn't like the advice being given.''       The debate over how terrorism suspects should be held and      questioned began shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks,      when the Bush administration adopted secret detention and      coercive interrogation, both practices the United States had      previously denounced when used by other countries. It adopted      the new measures without public debate or Congressional vote,      choosing to rely instead on the confidential legal advice of      a handful of appointees.       The policies set off bruising internal battles, pitting      administration moderates against hard-liners, military      lawyers against Pentagon chiefs and, most surprising, a      handful of conservative lawyers at the Justice Department      against the White House in the stunning mutiny of 2004. But      under Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Bradbury, the Justice      Department was wrenched back into line with the White      House.       After the Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that the Geneva      Conventions applied to prisoners who belonged to Al Qaeda,      President Bush for the first time acknowledged the C.I.A.'s      secret jails and ordered their inmates moved to Guantanamo      Bay, Cuba. The C.I.A. halted its use of waterboarding, or      pouring water over a bound prisoner's cloth-covered face to      induce fear of suffocation.       But in July, after a monthlong debate inside the      administration, President Bush signed a new executive order      authorizing the use of what the administration calls      ``enhanced'' interrogation techniques--the details remain      secret--and officials say the C.I.A. again is holding      prisoners in ``black sites'' overseas. The executive order      was reviewed and approved by Mr. Bradbury and the Office of      Legal Counsel.       Douglas W. Kmiec, who headed that office under President      Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush and wrote a      book about it, said he believed the intense pressures of the      campaign against terrorism have warped the office's proper      role.       ``The office was designed to insulate against any need to      be an advocate,'' said Mr. Kmiec, now a conservative scholar      at Pepperdine University law school. But at times in recent      years, Mr. Kmiec said, the office, headed by William H.      Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia before they served on the      Supreme Court, ``lost its ability to say no.'' ``The approach      changed dramatically with opinions on the war on terror,''      Mr. Kmiec said. ``The office became an advocate for the      president's policies.''       From the secret sites in Afghanistan, Thailand and Eastern      Europe where C.I.A. teams held Qaeda terrorists, questions      for the lawyers at C.I.A. headquarters arrived daily. Nervous      interrogators wanted to know: Are we breaking the laws      against torture? The Bush administration had entered      uncharted legal territory beginning in 2002, holding      prisoners outside the scrutiny of the International Red Cross      and subjecting them to harrowing pressure tactics. They      included slaps to the head; hours held naked in a frigid      cell; days and nights without sleep while battered by      thundering rock music; long periods manacled in stress      positions; or the ultimate, waterboarding.       Never in history had the United States authorized such      tactics. While President Bush and C.I.A. officials would      later insist that the harsh measures produced crucial      intelligence, many veteran interrogators, psychologists and      other experts say that less coercive methods are equally or      more effective.       With virtually no experience in interrogations, the C.I.A.      had constructed its program in a few harried months by      consulting Egyptian and Saudi intelligence officials and      copying Soviet interrogation methods long used in training      American service men to withstand capture. The agency      officers questioning prisoners constantly sought advice from      lawyers thousands of miles away.       ``We were getting asked about combinations--`Can we do this      and this at the same time?' '' recalled Paul C. Kelbaugh, a      veteran intelligence lawyer who was deputy legal counsel at      the C.I.A.'s Counterterrorist Center from 2001 to 2003.       Interrogators were worried that even approved techniques      had such a painful, multiplying effect when combined that      they might cross the legal line, Mr. Kelbaugh said. He      recalled agency officers asking: ``These approved techniques,      say, withholding food, and 50-degree temperature--can they be      combined?'' Or ``Do I have to do the less extreme before the      more extreme?''       The questions came more frequently, Mr. Kelbaugh said, as      word spread about a C.I.A. inspector general inquiry      unrelated to the war on terrorism. Some veteran C.I.A.      officers came under scrutiny because they were advisers to      Peruvian officers who in early 2001 shot down a missionary      flight they had mistaken for a drug-running aircraft. The      Americans were not charged with crimes, but they endured      three years of investigation, saw their careers derailed and      ran up big legal bills.       That experience shook the Qaeda interrogation team, Mr.      Kelbaugh said. ``You think you're making a difference and      maybe saving 3,000 American lives from the next attack. And      someone tells you, `Well, that guidance was a little vague,      and the inspector general wants to talk to you,' '' he      recalled. ``We couldn't tell them, `Do the best you can,'      because the people who did the best they could in Peru were      looking at a grand jury.'' Mr. Kelbaugh said the questions      were sometimes close calls that required consultation with      the Justice Department. But in August 2002, the department      provided a sweeping legal justification for even the harshest      tactics.       That opinion, which would become infamous as ``the torture      memo'' after it was leaked, was written largely by John Yoo,      a young Berkeley law professor serving in the Office of Legal      Counsel. His broad views of presidential power were shared by      Mr. Addington, the vice president's adviser. Their close      alliance provoked John Ashcroft, then the attorney general,      to refer privately to Mr. Yoo as Dr. Yes for his seeming      eagerness to give the White House whatever legal      justifications it desired, a Justice Department official      recalled.       Mr. Yoo's memorandum said no interrogation practices were      illegal unless they produced pain equivalent to organ failure      or ``even death.'' A second memo produced at the same time      spelled out the approved practices and how often or how long      they could be used. Despite that guidance, in March 2003,      when the C.I.A. caught Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the chief      planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, interrogators were again      haunted by uncertainty. Former intelligence officials, for      the first time, disclosed that a variety of tough      interrogation tactics were used about 100 times over two      weeks on Mr. Mohammed. Agency officials then ordered a halt,      fearing the combined assault might have amounted to illegal      torture. A C.I.A. spokesman, George Little, declined to      discuss the handling of Mr. Mohammed. Mr. Little said the      program ``has been conducted lawfully, with great care and      close review'' and ``has helped our country disrupt terrorist      plots and save innocent lives.''       ``The agency has always sought a clear legal framework,      conducting the program in strict accord with U.S. law, and      protecting the officers who go face-to-face with ruthless      terrorists,'' Mr. Little added.       Some intelligence officers say that many of Mr. Mohammed's      statements proved exaggerated or false. One problem, a former      senior agency official said, was that the C.I.A.'s initial      interrogators were not experts on Mr. Mohammed's background      or Al Qaeda, and it took about a month to get such an expert      to the secret prison. The former official said many C.I.A.      professionals now believe patient, repeated questioning by      well-informed experts is more effective than harsh physical      pressure.       Other intelligence officers, including Mr. Kelbaugh, insist      that the harsh treatment produced invaluable insights into Al      Qaeda's structure and plans. ``We leaned in pretty hard on      K.S.M.,'' Mr. Kelbaugh said, referring to Mr. Mohammed. ``We      were getting good information, and then they were told:      ``Slow it down. It may not be correct. Wait for some legal      clarification.''       The doubts at the C.I.A. proved prophetic. In late 2003,      after Mr. Yoo left the Justice Department, the new head of      the Office of Legal Counsel, Jack Goldsmith, began reviewing      his work, which he found deeply flawed. Mr. Goldsmith      infuriated White House officials, first by rejecting part of      the National Security Agency's surveillance program,      prompting the threat of mass resignations by top Justice      Department officials, including Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Comey,      and a showdown at the attorney general's hospital bedside.       Then, in June 2004, Mr. Goldsmith formally withdrew the      August 2002 Yoo memorandum on interrogation, which he found      overreaching and poorly reasoned. Mr. Goldsmith left the      Justice Department soon afterward. He first spoke at length      about his dissenting views to The New York Times last month,      and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on      Tuesday.       Six months later, the Justice Department quietly posted on      its Web site a new legal opinion that appeared to end any      flirtation with torture, starting with its clarionlike      opening: ``Torture is abhorrent both to American law and      values and to international norms.''       A single footnote--added to reassure the C.I.A.--suggested      that the Justice Department was not declaring the agency's      previous actions illegal. But the opinion was unmistakably a      retreat. Some White House officials had opposed publicizing      the document, but acquiesced to Justice Department officials      who argued that doing so would help clear the way for Mr.      Gonzales's confirmation as attorney general.       If President Bush wanted to make sure the Justice      Department did not rebel again, Mr. Gonzales was the ideal      choice. As White House counsel, he had been a fierce      protector of the president's prerogatives. Deeply loyal to      Mr. Bush for championing his career from their days in Texas,      Mr. Gonzales would sometimes tell colleagues that he had just      one regret about becoming attorney general: He did not see      nearly as much of the president as he had in his previous      post.        Among his first tasks at the Justice Department was to find      a trusted chief for the Office of Legal Counsel. First he      informed Daniel Levin, the acting head who had backed Mr.      Goldsmith's dissents and signed the new opinion renouncing      torture, that he would not get the job. He encouraged Mr.      Levin to take a position at the National Security Council, in      effect sidelining him.       Mr. Bradbury soon emerged as the presumed favorite. But      White House officials, still smarting from Mr. Goldsmith's      rebuffs, chose to delay his nomination. Harriet E. Miers, the      new White House counsel, ``decided to watch Bradbury for a      month or two. He was sort of on trial,'' one Justice      Department official recalled.       Mr. Bradbury's biography had a Horatio Alger element that      appealed to a succession of bosses, including Justice      Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court and Mr. Gonzales, the      son of poor immigrants. Mr. Bradbury's father had died when      he was an infant, and his mother took in laundry to support      her children. The first in his family to go to college, he      attended Stanford and the University of Michigan Law School.      He joined the law firm of Kirkland  Ellis, where he came      under the tutelage of Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater      independent prosecutor.       Mr. Bradbury belonged to the same circle as his      predecessors: young, conservative lawyers with sterling      credentials, often with clerkships for prominent conservative      judges and ties to the Federalist Society, a powerhouse of      the legal right. Mr. Yoo, in fact, had proposed his old      friend Mr. Goldsmith for the Office of Legal Counsel job; Mr.      Goldsmith had hired Mr. Bradbury as his top deputy.       ``We all grew up together,'' said Viet D. Dinh, an      assistant attorney general from 2001 to 2003 and very much a      member of the club. ``You start with a small universe of      Supreme Court clerks, and you narrow it down from there.''       But what might have been subtle differences in quieter      times now cleaved them into warring camps.       Justice Department colleagues say Mr. Gonzales was soon      meeting frequently with Mr. Bradbury on national security      issues, a White House priority. Admirers describe Mr.      Bradbury as low-key but highly skilled, a conciliator who      brought from 10 years of corporate practice a more pragmatic      approach to the job than Mr. Yoo and Mr. Goldsmith, both from      the academic world.       ``As a practicing lawyer, you know how to address real      problems,'' said Noel J. Francisco, who worked at the Justice      Department from 2003 to 2005. ``At O.L.C., you're not writing      law review articles and you're not theorizing. You're giving      a client practical advice on a real problem.''       As he had at the White House, Mr. Gonzales usually said      little in meetings with other officials, often deferring to      the hard-driving Mr. Addington. Mr. Bradbury also often      appeared in accord with the vice president's lawyer.       Mr. Bradbury appeared to be ``fundamentally sympathetic to      what the White House and the C.I.A. wanted to do,'' recalled      Philip Zelikow, a former top State Department official. At      interagency meetings on detention and interrogation, Mr.      Addington was at times ``vituperative,'' said Mr. Zelikow,      but Mr. Bradbury, while taking similar positions, was      ``professional and collegial.''       While waiting to learn whether he would be nominated to      head the Office of Legal Counsel, Mr. Bradbury was in an      awkward position, knowing that a decision contrary to White      House wishes could kill his chances.       Charles J. Cooper, who headed the Office of Legal Counsel      under President Reagan, said he was ``very troubled'' at the      notion of a probationary period.       ``If the purpose of the delay was a tryout, I think they      should have avoided it,'' Mr. Cooper said. ``You're implying      that the acting official is molding his or her legal analysis      to win the job.''       Mr. Bradbury said he made no such concessions. ``No one      ever suggested to me that my nomination depended on how I      ruled on any opinion,'' he said. ``Every opinion I've signed      at the Office of Legal Counsel represents my best judgment of      what the law requires.''       Scott Horton, an attorney affiliated with Human Rights      First who has closely followed the interrogation debate, said      any official offering legal advice on the campaign against      terror was on treacherous ground.       ``For government lawyers, the national security issues they      were deciding were like working with nuclear waste--extremely      hazardous to their health,'' Mr. Horton said. ``If you give      the administration what it wants, you'll lose credibility in      the academic community,'' he said. ``But if you hold back,      you'll be vilified by conservatives and the administration.''       In any case, the White House grew comfortable with Mr.      Bradbury's approach. He helped block the appointment of a      liberal Ivy League law professor to a career post in the      Office of Legal Counsel. And he signed the opinion approving      combined interrogation techniques.       Mr. Comey strongly objected and told associates that he      advised Mr. Gonzales not to endorse the opinion. But the      attorney general made clear that the White House was adamant      about it, and that he would do nothing to resist.       Under Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Comey's opposition might have      killed the opinion. An imposing former prosecutor and self-     described conservative who stands 6-foot-8, he was the rare      administration official who was willing to confront Mr.      Addington. At one testy 2004 White House meeting, when Mr.      Comey stated that ``no lawyer'' would endorse Mr. Yoo's      justification for the N.S.A. program, Mr. Addington demurred,      saying he was a lawyer and found it convincing. Mr. Comey      shot back: ``No good lawyer,'' according to someone present.       But under Mr. Gonzales, and after the departure of Mr.      Goldsmith and other allies, the deputy attorney general found      himself isolated. His troublemaking on N.S.A. and on      interrogation, and in appointing his friend Patrick J.      Fitzgerald as special prosecutor in the C.I.A. leak case,      which would lead to the perjury conviction of I. Lewis Libby,      Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, had irreparably offended the      White House.       ``On national security matters generally, there was a sense      that Comey was a wimp and that Comey was disloyal,'' said one      Justice Department official who heard the White House talk,      expressed with particular force by Mr. Addington.       Mr. Comey provided some hints of his thinking about      interrogation and related issues in a speech that spring.      Speaking at the N.S.A.'s Fort Meade campus on Law Day--a      noteworthy setting for the man who had helped lead the      dissent a year earlier that forced some changes in the N.S.A.      program--Mr. Comey spoke of the ``agonizing collisions'' of      the law and the desire to protect Americans.       ``We are likely to hear the words: `If we don't do this,      people will die,' '' Mr. Comey said. But he argued that      government lawyers must uphold the principles of their great      institutions.       ``It takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say `no'      when it matters most,'' he said. ``It takes moral character.      It takes an understanding that in the long run, intelligence      under law is the only sustainable intelligence in this      country.''       Mr. Gonzales's aides were happy to see Mr. Comey depart in      the summer of 2005. That June, President Bush nominated Mr.      Bradbury to head the Office of Legal Counsel, which some      colleagues viewed as a sign that he had passed a loyalty      test. Soon Mr. Bradbury applied his practical approach to a      new challenge to the C.I.A.'s methods.       The administration had always asserted that the C.I.A.'s      pressure tactics did not amount to torture, which is banned      by federal law and international treaty. But officials had      privately decided the agency did not have to comply with      another provision in the Convention Against Torture--the      prohibition on ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading'' treatment.       Now that loophole was about to be closed. First Senator      Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and then Senator      John McCain, the Arizona Republican who had been tortured as      a prisoner in North Vietnam, proposed legislation to ban such      treatment. At the administration's request, Mr. Bradbury      assessed whether the proposed legislation would outlaw any      C.I.A. methods, a legal question that had never before been      answered by the Justice Department.       At least a few administration officials argued that no      reasonable interpretation of ``cruel, inhuman or degrading''      would permit the most extreme C.I.A. methods, like      waterboarding. Mr. Bradbury was placed in a tough spot, said      Mr. Zelikow, the State Department counselor, who was working      at the time to rein in interrogation policy. ``If Justice      says some practices are in violation of the C.I.D.      standard,'' Mr. Zelikow said, referring to cruel, inhuman or      degrading, ``then they are now saying that officials broke      current law.''       In the end, Mr. Bradbury's opinion delivered what the White      House wanted: a statement that the standard imposed by Mr.      McCain's Detainee Treatment Act would not force any change in      the C.I.A.'s practices, according to officials familiar with      the memo. Relying on a Supreme Court finding that only      conduct that ``shocks the conscience'' was unconstitutional,      the opinion found that in some circumstances not even      waterboarding was necessarily cruel, inhuman or degrading,      if, for example, a suspect was believed to possess crucial      intelligence about a planned terrorist attack, the officials      familiar with the legal finding said.       In a frequent practice, Mr. Bush attached a statement to      the new law when he signed it, declaring his authority to set      aside the restrictions if they interfered with his      constitutional powers. At the same time, though, the      administration responded to pressure from Mr. McCain and      other lawmakers by reviewing interrogation policy and giving      up several C.I.A. techniques.       Since late 2005, Mr. Bradbury has become a linchpin of the      administration's defense of counterterrorism programs,      helping to negotiate the Military Commissions Act last year      and frequently testifying about the N.S.A. surveillance      program. Once, he answered questions about administration      detention policies for an ``Ask the White House'' feature on      a Web site.       Mr. Kmiec, the former Office of Legal Counsel head now at      Pepperdine, called Mr. Bradbury's public activities a      departure for an office that traditionally has shunned any      advocacy role.       A senior administration official called Mr. Bradbury's      active role in shaping legislation and speaking to Congress      and the press ``entirely appropriate'' and consistent with      past practice. The official, who spoke on the condition of      anonymity, said Mr. Bradbury ``has played a critical role in      achieving greater transparency'' on the legal basis for      detention and surveillance programs.        Though President Bush repeatedly nominated Mr. Bradbury as      the Office of Legal Counsel's assistant attorney general,      Democratic senators have blocked the nomination. Senator      Durbin said the Justice Department would not turn over copies      of his opinions or other evidence of Mr. Bradbury's role in      interrogation policy.       ``There are fundamental questions about whether Mr.      Bradbury approved interrogation methods that are clearly      unacceptable,'' Mr. Durbin said.       John D. Hutson, who served as the Navy's top lawyer from      1997 to 2000, said he believed that the existence of legal      opinions justifying abusive treatment is pernicious,      potentially blurring the rules for Americans handling      prisoners.       ``I know from the military that if you tell someone they      can do a little of this for the country's good, some people      will do a lot of it for the country's better,'' Mr. Hutson      said. Like other military lawyers, he also fears that      official American acceptance of such treatment could endanger      Americans in the future.       ``The problem is, once you've got a legal opinion that says      such a technique is O.K., what happens when one of our people      is captured and they do it to him? How do we protest then?''      he asked.",

Our bill will put 230 new counterterrorism agents on the beat and give agents new tools to collect intelligence to protect Americans here at home. At the same time, the President's budget cut 100 FBI agents dedicated to fighting violent crime. This is outrageous--because for the first time in almost 15 years, violent crime has increased. Robberies are up 7 percent. Homicides are up 2 percent. Nearly every region of the country has been affected--from large cities to small communities. We've heard from our colleagues that the FBI needs more agents fighting violent crime in their communities. The CJS bill rejects the President's irresponsible cut.

Each and every one of them does a good job of intelligence collection--the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Department of State Intelligence and Research Bureau, and the Department of Energy's Intelligence Office which is critical to doing an assessment of nuclear capability, and the National Security Agency, just to name a few. They provide analytic assessments on an hour-to-hour, day-to-day basis. They can tell us better than any other group the current situation in Iraq. We need to know what their consensus opinion is before we decide in advance whether or not this war should be undertaken. I firmly believe that policymakers in both the executive branch and the Congress--the President, the White House, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Congress--would benefit from the production of a coordinated consensus document produced by all relevant components of the intelligence community on the current and projected status of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.",

        "statement": "``God help this country when someone sits in this chair who      doesn't know the military as well as I do.''--President      Dwight D. Eisenhower       In late December, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta assured      Representative Frank Wolf (R-VA) that the United States was      ``making undeniable progress'' in its war in Afghanistan and      that a congressionally mandated, independent assessment of      the war was ``not necessary.'' However, recent media reports      of internal Department of Defense and Intelligence Community      assessments of the war contradict, again, claims of progress      and illustrate instead that the war is stalemated with US      policies over the last several years weakening the Karzai      government and alienating the Afghan population, while      strengthening the Afghan insurgency and ruining the US      relationship with nuclear armed Pakistan. Independent studies      of the conflict by non-government and international      organizations corroborate these reports and assessments.       Today, the New York Times reports that an active duty Army      officer, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel L. Davis, has submitted a      classified report to members of Congress that documents the      failings of US policy in Afghanistan. More importantly, LTC      Davis attests that senior leaders of the Department of      Defense, both uniformed and civilian, have intentionally and      consistently misled the American people and Congress on the      conduct and progress of the Afghan War. The 58-page      classified report he prepared, briefed and submitted to      senators, representatives and cleared staff members over the      last few      weeks utilizes nearly 50 historical and current classified      sources and draws from 250 interviews he conducted with      soldiers throughout Afghanistan during his most recent year-     long combat deployment.       In addition to the classified report, LTC Davis has written      an 86-page unclassified version, as well as an article,      published today by the Armed Forces Journal. These reports      depict a near institutionalizing of dishonesty and deception      by senior DOD leadership towards the American public and      Congress. LTC Davis documents, as well, examples from the      Iraq war and major weapons procurement programs to illustrate      the persistent duplicity of the Pentagon's senior ranks.      Victory narratives, career ambitions and institutional      protection fuel these deceits. Deceits that have only      delivered the loss of thousands of lives, the waste of      hundreds of billions of dollars and the failure to achieve      American policy objectives.       LTC Davis has submitted his reports to the Department of      the Army, his chain of command and the Department of Defense      Inspector General. Hard copies of the classified reports are      available for viewing by appropriately cleared members and      staff of Congress. However, DOD has not publicly released the      unclassified version, even with it being verified as not      containing classified information. This is in spite of LTC      Davis having provided the report for review to the Defense      Department over two weeks ago (Defense Department regulations      require only a 10 business day review). I am not surprised      DOD is slow with its approval; his allegations are harsh and      damning, although accurate and honest.       Danny Davis is a friend of mine; we have known each other      since the fall of 2009. Bonding over coffees and lunches as      rightful skeptics of the escalation of the Afghan war, we are      now observing our worst concerns being realized. At a cost of      over 11,000 killed and wounded Americans, the surge in      Afghanistan is now being wound down without the achievement      of its core objectives.* However, accompanying such a      failure, are triumphant claims of success and accomplishment      from American generals and their civilian counterparts. For      those that comprehend the true consequences of this war: the      cold, waxen dead; the mutilated flesh and shattered bone; the      fatherless children so very young and the new widows so alone      and so heartbroken; such specious and unfounded claims of      progress without fact in this war are reckless, dishonorable      and injurious.       Over the last several months, at great risk to his career      and personal life, LTC Davis has documented the deliberate      misleading of the American people and Congress by the leaders      of the Department of Defense.** He has done his nation and      the United States Army a tremendous service. Thus far the      Army has taken no punitive action against LTC Davis, however,      I have no doubt his character and motivations will ultimately      be attacked and disparaged. I suspect elements of DOD      leadership and their supporters will seek to discredit him      and persecute him. I am afraid he will face significant, but      spurious, investigations and prosecutions for his truth      telling actions, such as Justice Department lawyer Thomas      Tamm or National Security Agency employee Thomas Drake had to      suffer, or that State Department officer Peter Van Buren is      currently enduring.       Over 5,500 Americans were killed or wounded in Afghanistan      in 2011. Tens of thousands who have come home will soldier a      lifetime with the unseen scars of post-traumatic stress or      traumatic brain injury. Our service members find themselves      held to account on a callous and unsympathetic battlefield in      a schizophrenic and absurd war. They do what is expected of      them and hold themselves responsible to those who depend on      them.       In contrast, for those in Washington charged with the      decisions of war and peace, many of the participants seem to      alternate between Pollyannas, chickenhawks and those who have      lost sight of the difference between respect for and      deference to the military. Any accounting for last year's      5,500 killed and wounded, if the discussants are even aware      of the toll, is only a mathematical exercise, and an abstract      one at that.       We expect our service members in Afghanistan to do the      hard, brutal and savage fighting our policies ask of them      without question. They do. Their expectation of those of us      in Washington, those of us in our heated offices, wearing      ties and high heels, who wake each day safe with our      families, is that we ask hard questions, examine the reality      of the conflict and not accept assertions of success without      evidence.       The assumptions underlying the escalation of the Afghan war      were incorrect. The Afghan surge, viewed by policy makers and      some in the military as some form of social experiment to      validate personal and institutional legacies and theories,      rather than achieve US objectives worthy of bodily sacrifice,      is failing. LTC Davis has demonstrated the courage to expose      the deceptions that perpetuate this war, its failings and its      deaths. It is now up to the American people and its Congress      to hold those who were not just wrong, but mendacious, to      account.       * To be clear, however, continuation of the current war      policy would simply be madness. Secretary Panetta's recent      announcement to end US combat operations in 2013 is a wise      decision (wiser if it had been made in 2009); particularly if      this policy shift is coupled with a transition of the role of      the US from belligerent in the conflict to mediator of an      inclusive political process to settle the three decade plus      Afghan war.       ** Myself and investigative journalist and historian Gareth      Porter, and former intelligence officer and author Tony      Shaffer, have provided moral support throughout this process.",

        "statement": "Since the National Security Act's establishment of the      Director of Central Intelligence and the Central Intelligence      Agency in 1947, numerous independent commissions, experts,      and legislative initiatives have examined the growth and      performance of the U.S. Intelligence Community. While those      efforts generated numerous proposals for reform over the      years, some of the most significant proposals have not been      implemented, particularly in the areas of organization and      structure. These Committees believe that the cataclysmic      events of September 11, 2001 provide a unique and compelling      mandate for strong leadership and constructive change      throughout the Intelligence Community. With that in mind, and      based on the work of this Joint Inquiry, the committees      recommend the following:       1. Congress should amend the National Security Act of 1947      to create and sufficiently staff a statutory Director of      National Intelligence who shall be the President's principal      advisor on intelligence and shall have the full range of      management, budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed      to make the entire U.S. Intelligence Community operate as a      coherent whole. These responsibilities should include:      Establishment and enforcement of consistent priorities for      the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence      throughout the Intelligence Community; setting of policy and      the ability to move personnel between elements of the      Intelligence Community; review, approval, modification, and      primary management and oversight of the execution of      Intelligence Community budgets; review, approval      modification, and primary management and oversight of the      execution of Intelligence Community personnel and resource      allocations; review, approval, modification, and primary      management and oversight of the execution of Intelligence      Community research and development efforts; review, approval,      and coordination of relationships between the Intelligence      Community agencies and foreign intelligence and law      enforcement services; and exercise of statutory authority to      insure that Intelligence Community agencies and components      fully comply with Community-wide policy, management,      spending, and administrative guidance and priorities.       The Director of National Intelligence should be a Cabinet      level position, appointed      by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. Congress      and the President should also work to insure that the      Director of National Intelligence effectively exercises these      authorities.       To insure focused and consistent Intelligence Community      leadership, Congress should require that no person may      simultaneously serve as both the Director of National      Intelligence and the Director of the Central Intelligence      Agency, or as the director of any other specific intelligence      agency.       2. Current efforts by the National Security Council to      examine and revamp existing intelligence priorities should be      expedited, given the immediate need for clear guidance in      intelligence and counterterrorism efforts. The President      should take action to ensure that clear, consistent, and      current priorities are established and enforced throughout      the Intelligence Community. Once established, these      priorities should be reviewed and updated on at least an      annual basis to ensure that the allocation of Intelligence      Community resources reflects and effectively addresses the      continually evolving threat environment. Finally, the      establishment of Intelligence Community priorities, and      the justification for such priorities, should be reported      to both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on an      annual basis.       3. The National Security Council, in conjunction with the      Director of National Intelligence, and in consultation with      the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the      Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, should prepare,      for the President's approval, a U.S. government-wide strategy      for combating terrorism, both at home and abroad, including      the growing terrorism threat posed by the proliferation of      weapons of mass destruction and associated technologies. This      strategy should identify and full engage those foreign      policy, economic, military, intelligence, and law enforcement      elements that are critical to a comprehensive blueprint for      success in the war against terrorism.       As part of that effort, the Director of National      Intelligence shall develop the Intelligence Community      component of the strategy, identifying specific programs and      budgets and including plans to address the threats posed by      Usama Bin Ladin and al Qa'ida, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other      significant terrorist groups. Consistent with applicable law,      the strategy should effectively employ and integrate all      capabilities available to the Intelligence Community against      those threats and should encompass specific efforts to:      Develop human sources to penetrate terrorist organizations      and networks both overseas and within the United States;      fully utilize existing and future technologies to better      exploit terrorist communications; to improve and expand the      use of data mining and other cutting edge analytical tools;      and to develop a multi-level security capability to      facilitate the timely and complete sharing of relevant      intelligence information both within the Intelligence      Community and with other appropriate federal, state, and      local authorities; enhance the depth and quality of domestic      intelligence collection and analysis by, for example,      modernizing current intelligence reporting formats through      the use of existing information technology to emphasize the      existence and the significance of links between new and      previously acquired information; maximize the effective use      of covert action in counterterrorist efforts; develop      programs to deal with financial support for international      terrorism; and facilitate the ability of CIA paramilitary      units and military special operations forces to conduct joint      operations against terrorist targets.       4. The position of National Intelligence Officer for      Terrorism should be created on the National Intelligence      Council and a highly qualified individual appointed to      prepare intelligence estimates on terrorism for the use of      Congress and policymakers in the Executive Branch and to      assist the Intelligence Community in developing a program for      strategic analysis and assessments.       5. Congress and the Administration should ensure the full      development within the Department of Homeland Security of an      effective all-source terrorism information fusion center that      will dramatically improve the focus and quality of      counterterrorism analysis and facilitate the timely      dissemination of relevant intelligence information, both      within and beyond the boundaries of the Intelligence      Community. Congress and the Administration should ensure that      this fusion center has all the authority and the resources      needed to: Have full and timely access to all      counterterrorism-related intelligence information, including      ``raw'' supporting data as needed; have the ability to      participate fully in the existing requirements process for      tasking the Intelligence Community to gather information on      foreign individuals, entities and threats; integrate such      information in order to identify and assess the nature and      scope of terrorist threats to the United States in light      of actual and potential vulnerabilities; implement and      fully utilize data mining and other advanced analytical      tools, consistent with applicable law; retain a permanent      staff of experienced and highly skilled analysts,      supplemented on a regular basis by personnel on ``joint      tours'' from the various Intelligence Community agencies;      institute a reporting mechanism that enables analysts at      all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to post      lead information for use by analysts at other agencies      without waiting for dissemination of a formal report;      maintain excellence and creativity in staff analytic      skills through regular use of analysis and language      training programs; and establish and sustain effective      channels for the exchange of counterterrorism-related      information with federal agencies outside the Intelligence      Community as well as with state and local authorities.       6. Given the FBI's history of repeated shortcomings within      its current responsibility for domestic intelligence, and in      the face of grave and immediate threats to our homeland, the      FBI should strengthen and improve its domestic capability as      fully and expeditiously as possible by immediately      instituting measures to: Strengthen counterterrorism as a      national FBI program by clearly designating national      counterterrorism priorities and enforcing field office      adherence to those priorities; establish and sustain      independent career tracks within the FBI that recognize and      provide incentives for demonstrated skills and performance of      counterterrorism agents and analysts; significantly improve      strategic analytical capabilities by assuring the      qualification, training, and independence of analysts,      coupled with sufficient access to necessary information and      resources; establish a strong reports officer cadre at FBI      Headquarters and field offices to facilitate timely      dissemination of intelligence from agents to analysts within      the FBI and other agencies within the Intelligence Community;      implement training for agents in the effective use of      analysts and analysis in their work; expand and sustain the      recruitment of agents and analysts with the linguistic skills      needed in counterterrorism efforts; increase substantially      efforts to penetrate terrorist organizations operating in the      United States through all available means of collection;      improve the national security law training of FBI personnel;      implement mechanisms to maximize the exchange of      counterterrorism-related information between the FBI and      other federal, state and local agencies; and finally solve      the FBI's persistent and incapacitating information      technology problems.       7. Congress and the Administration should carefully      consider how best to structure and manage U.S. domestic      intelligence responsibilities. Congress should review the      scope of domestic intelligence authorities to determine their      adequacy in pursuing counterterrorism at home and ensuring      the protection of privacy and other rights guaranteed under      the Constitution. This review should include, for example,      such questions as whether the range of persons subject to      searches and surveillances authorized under the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) should be expanded.       Based on their oversight responsibilities, the Intelligence      and Judiciary Committees of the Congress, as appropriate,      should consider promptly, in consultation with the      Administration, whether the FBI should continue to perform      the domestic intelligence functions of the United States      Government or whether legislation is necessary to remedy this      problem, including the possibility of creating a new agency      to perform those functions.       Congress should require that the new Director of National      Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of the      Department of Homeland Security report to the President and      the Congress on a date certain concerning: The FBI's progress      since September 11, 2001 in implementing the reforms required      to conduct an effective domestic intelligence program,      including the measures recommended above; the experience of      other democratic nations in organizing the conduct of      domestic intelligence; the specific manner in which a new      domestic intelligence service could be established in the      United States, recognizing the need to enhance national      security while fully protecting civil liberties; and their      recommendations on how to best fulfill the nation's need for      an effective domestic intelligence capability, including      necessary legislation.       8. The Attorney General and the Director of the FBI should      take action necessary to ensure that: The office of      Intelligence Policy and Review and other Department of      Justice components provide in-depth training to the FBI and      other members of the Intelligence Community regarding the use      of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to      address terrorist threats to the United States; the FBI      disseminates results of searches and surveillances authorized      under FISA to appropriate personnel within the FBI and the      Intelligence Community on a timely basis so they may be used      for analysis and operations that address terrorist threats to      the United States; and the FBI develops and implements a plan      to use authorities provided by FISA to assess the threat of      international terrorist groups within the United States      fully, including the extent to which such groups are funded      or otherwise supported by foreign governments.       9. The House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary      Committees should continue to examine the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act and its implementation      thoroughly, particularly with respect to changes made as a      result of the USA PATRIOT Act and the subsequent decision of      the United States Foreign Intelligence Court of Review, to      determine whether its provisions adequately address present      and emerging terrorist threats to the United States.      Legislation should be proposed by those Committees to remedy      any deficiencies identified as a result of that review.       10. The Director of the National Security Agency should      present to the Director of National Intelligence and the      Secretary of Defense by June 30, 2003, and report to the      House and Senate Intelligence Committees, a detailed plan      that: Describes solutions for the technological challenges      for signals intelligence; requires a review, on a quarterly      basis, of the goals, products to be delivered, funding levels      and schedules for every technology development program;      ensures strict accounting for program expenditures; within      their jurisdiction as established by current law, makes NSA a      full collaborating partner with the Central Intelligence      Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the war on      terrorism, including fully integrating the collection and      analytic capabilities of NSA, CIA, and the FBI; and makes      recommendations for legislation needed to facilitate these      goals.       In evaluating the plan, the Committees should also consider      issues pertaining to whether civilians should be appointed to      the position of Director of the National Security Agency and      whether the term of service for the position should be longer      than it has been in the recent past.       11. Recognizing that the Intelligence Community's employees      remain its greatest resource, the Director of National      Intelligence should require that measures be implemented to      greatly enhance the recruitment and development of a      workforce with the intelligence skills and expertise needed      for success in counterterrorist efforts, including: The      agencies of the Intelligence Community should act promptly to      expand and improve counterterrorism training programs within      the Community, insuring coverage of such critical areas as      information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence      personnel; language capabilities; the use of the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act; and watchlisting; the      Intelligence Community should build on the provisions of the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 regarding      the development of language capabilities, including the Act's      requirement for a report on the feasibility of establishing a      Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps, and implement expeditiously      measures to identify and recruit linguists outside the      Community whose abilities are relevant to the needs of      counterterrorism; the existing Intelligence Community Reserve      Corps should be expanded to ensure the use of relevant      personnel and expertise from outside the Community as special      needs arise; Congress should consider enacting legislation,      modeled on the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, to instill the      concept of ``jointness'' throughout the Intelligence      Community. By emphasizing such things as joint education, a      joint career specialty, increased authority for regional      commanders, and joint exercises, that Act greatly enhanced      the joint warfighting capabilities of the individual military      services. Legislation to instill similar concepts throughout      the Intelligence Community could help improve management of      Community resources and priorities and insure a far more      effective ``team'' effort by all the intelligence agencies.      The Director of National Intelligence should require more      extensive use of ``joint tours'' for intelligence and      appropriate law enforcement personnel to broaden their      experience and help bridge existing organizational and      cultural divides through service in other agencies. These      joint tours should include not only service at Intelligence      Community agencies, but also service in those agencies that      are users or consumers of intelligence products. Serious      incentives for joint service should be established throughout      the Intelligence Community and personnel should be rewarded      for joint service with career advancement credit at      individual agencies. The Director of National Intelligence      should also require Intelligence Community agencies to      participate in joint exercises; Congress should expand and      improve existing educational grant programs focused on      intelligence-related fields, similar to military      scholarship programs and others that provide financial      assistance in return for a commitment to serve in the      Intelligence Community; and the Intelligence Community      should enhance recruitment of a more ethnically and      culturally diverse workforce and devise a strategy to      capitalize upon the unique cultural and linguistic      capabilities of first-generation Americans, a strategy      designed to utilize their skills to the greatest practical      effect while recognizing the potential counterintelligence      challenges such hiring decisions might pose.       12. Steps should be taken to increase and ensure the      greatest return on this nation's substantial investment in      intelligence, including: The President should submit budget      recommendations, and Congress should enact budget authority,      for sustained, long-term investment in counterterrorism      capabilities that avoid dependence on repeated stop-gap      supplemental appropriations; in making such budget      recommendations, the President should provide for the      consideration of a separate classified Intelligence Community      budget; long-term counterterrorism investment should be      accompanied by sufficient flexibility, subject to      congressional oversight, to enable the Intelligence Community      to rapidly respond to altered or unanticipated needs; the      Director of National Intelligence should insure that      Intelligence Community budgeting practices and procedures are      revised to better identify the levels and nature of      counterterrorism funding within the Community;      counterterrorism funding should be allocated in accordance      with the program requirements of the national      counterterrorism strategy; and due consideration should be      given to directing an outside agency or entity to conduct a      thorough and rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the resources      spent on intelligence.       13. The State Department, in consultation with the      Department of Justice, should review and report to the      President and the Congress by June 30, 2003 on the extent to      which revisions in bilateral and multilateral agreements,      including extradition and mutual assistance treaties, would      strengthen U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The review should      address the degree to which current categories of      extraditable offenses should be expanded to cover offenses,      such as visa and immigration fraud, which may be particularly      useful against terrorists and those who support them.       14. Recognizing the importance of intelligence in this      nation's struggle against terrorism, Congress should maintain      vigorous, informed, and constructive oversight of the      Intelligence Community. To best achieve that goal, the      National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United      States should study and make recommendations concerning how      Congress may improve its oversight of the Intelligence      Community, including consideration of such areas as: Changes      in the budgetary process; changes in the rules regarding      membership on the oversight committees; whether oversight      responsibility should be vested in a joint House-Senate      Committee or, as currently exists, in separate Committees      in each house; the extent to which classification      decisions impair congressional oversight; and how      Congressional oversight can best contribute to the      continuing need of the Intelligence Community to evolve      and adapt to changes in the subject matter of intelligence      and the needs of policy makers.       15. The President should review and consider amendments to      the Executive Orders, policies and procedures that govern the      national security classification of intelligence information,      in an effort to expand access to relevant information for      federal agencies outside the Intelligence Community, for      state and local authorities, which are critical to the fight      against terrorism, and for the American public. In addition,      the President and the heads of federal agencies should ensure      that the policies and procedures to protect against the      unauthorized disclosure of classified intelligence      information are well understood, fully implemented and      vigorously enforced.       Congress should also review the statutes, policies and      procedures that govern the national security classification      of intelligence information and its protection from      unauthorized disclosure. Among other matters, Congress should      consider the degree to which excessive classification has      been used in the past and the extent to which the emerging      threat environment has greatly increased the need for real-     time sharing of sensitive information. The Director of      National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of      Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland      Security, and the Attorney General, should review and report      to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on proposals      for a new and more realistic approach to the processes and      structures that have governed the designation of sensitive      and classified information. The report should include      proposals to protect against the use of the classification      process as a shield to protect agency self-interest.       16. Assured standards of accountability are critical to      developing the personal responsibility, urgency, and      diligence which our counterterrorism responsibility requires.      Given the absence of any substantial efforts within the      Intelligence Community to impose accountability in relation      to the events of September 11, 2001, the Director of Central      Intelligence and the heads of Intelligence Community agencies      should require that measures designed to ensure      accountability are implemented throughout the Community. To      underscore the need for accountability: The Director of      Central Intelligence should report to the House and Senate      Intelligence Committees no later than June 30, 2003 as to the      steps taken to implement a system of accountability      throughout the Intelligence Community, to include processes      for identifying poor performance and affixing responsibility      for it, and for recognizing and rewarding excellence in      performance; as part of the confirmation process for      Intelligence Community officials, Congress should require      from those officials an affirmative commitment to the      implementation and use of strong accountability mechanisms      throughout the Intelligence Community; and the Inspectors      General at the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of      Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of      State should review the factual findings and the record of      this Inquiry and conduct investigations and reviews as      necessary to determine whether and to what extent personnel      at all levels should be held accountable for any omission,      commission, or failure to meet professional standards in      regard to the identification, prevention, or disruption of      terrorist attacks, including the events of September 11,      2001. These reviews should also address those individuals who      performed in a stellar or exceptional manner, and the degree      to which the quality of their performance was rewarded or      otherwise impacted their careers. Based on those      investigations and reviews, agency heads should      take appropriate disciplinary and other action and the      President and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees      should be advised of such action.       17. The Administration should review and report to the      House and Senate Intelligence Committees by June 30, 2003      regarding what      progress has been made in reducing the inappropriate and      obsolete barriers among intelligence and law enforcement      agencies engaged in counterterrorism, what remains to be done      to reduce those barriers, and what legislative actions may be      advisable in that regard. In particular, this report should      address what steps are being taken to insure that perceptions      within the Intelligence Community about the scope and limits      of current law and policy with respect to restrictions on      collection and information sharing are, in fact, accurate and      well-founded.       18. Congress and the Administration should ensure the full      development of a national watchlist center that will be      responsible for coordinating and integrating all terrorist-     related watchlist systems; promoting awareness and use of the      center by all relevant government agencies and elements of      the private sector; and ensuring a consistent and      comprehensive flow of terrorist names into the center from      all relevant points of collection.       19. The Intelligence Community, and particularly the FBI      and the CIA, should aggressively address the possibility that      foreign governments are providing support to or are involved      in terrorist activity targeting the United States and U.S.      interests. State-sponsored terrorism substantially increases      the likelihood of successful and more lethal attacks within      the United States. This issue must be addressed from a      national standpoint and should not be limited in focus by the      geographical and factual boundaries of individual cases. The      FBI and CIA should aggressively and thoroughly pursue related      matters developed through this Joint Inquiry that have been      referred to them for further investigation by these      Committees.       The Intelligence Community should fully inform the House      and Senate Intelligence Committees of significant      developments in these efforts, through regular reports and      additional communications as necessary, and the Committees      should, in turn, exercise vigorous and continuing oversight ",

        "statement": "Dear Representative Sensenbrenner: This responds to your      letter to the Attorney General date June 6, 2013, regarding      the ``business records'' provision of the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1861,      enacted as section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.       As you know, on June 5, 2013, the media reported the      unauthorized disclosure of a classified judicial order issued      under this provision that has been used to support a      sensitive intelligence collection program. Under this      program, which has been briefed to Congress and repeatedly      authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      (FISC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) obtains      authorization to collect telephony metadata, including the      telephone numbers dialed and the date, time and duration of      calls, from certain telecommunications service providers. The      National Security Agency (NSA), in turn, archives and      analyzes this information under carefully controlled      circumstances and provides leads to the FBI or others in the      Intelligence Community for counterterrorism purposes. Aspects      of this program remain classified, and there are limits to      what can be said about it in an unclassified letter.      Department of Justice and Intelligence Community staff are      available to provide you a briefing on the program at your      request.       In your letter, you asked whether this intelligence      collection program is consistent with the requirements of      section 215 and the limits of that authority. Under section      215, the Director of the FBI may apply to the FISC for an      order directing the production of any tangible things,      including business records, for investigations to protect      against international terrorism. To issue such an order, the      FISC must determine that (1) there are reasonable grounds to      believe that the things sought are relevant to an authorized      investigation, other than a threat assessment; (2) the      investigation is being conducted under guidelines approved by      the Attorney General under Executive Order 12333; and (3) if      a U.S. person is the subject of the investigation, the      investigation is not being conducted solely upon the basis of      First Amendment protected activities. In addition, the FISC      may only require the production of items that can be obtained      with a grand jury subpoena or any other court order directing      the production of records or tangible things. Finally, the      program must, of course, comport with the Constitution.       The telephony metadata program satisfies each of these      requirements. The lawfulness of the telephony metadata      collection program has repeatedly been affirmed by the FISC.      In the years since its inception, multiple FISC judges have      granted 90-day extensions of the program after concluding      that it meets all applicable legal requirements.       Of particular significance to your question is the      relevance to an authorized international terrorism      investigation of the telephony metadata collected through      this program. First, it is critical to understand the program      in the context of the restrictions imposed by the court.      Those restrictions strictly limit the extent to which the      data is reviewed by the government. In particular, the FISC      allows the data to be queried for intelligence purposes only      when there is reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts,      that a particular query term, such as a telephone number, is      associated with a specific foreign terrorist organization      that was previously identified to and approved by the court.      NSA has reported that in 2012, fewer than 300 unique      identifiers were used to query the data after meeting this      standard. This means that only a very small fraction of the      records is ever reviewed by any person, and only specially      cleared counterterrorism personnel specifically trained in      the court-approved procedures can access the records to      conduct queries. The information generated in response to      these limited queries is not only relevant to authorized      investigations of international terrorism, but may be      especially significant in helping the government identify and      disrupt terrorist plots.       The large volume of telephony metadata is relevant to FBI      investigations into specific foreign terrorist organizations      because the intelligence tools that NSA uses to identify the      existence of potential terrorist communications within the      data require collecting and storing large volumes of the      metadata to enable later analysis. If not collected and held      by NSA, the metadata may not continue to be available for the      period that NSA has deemed necessary for national security      purposes because it need not be retained by      telecommunications service providers. Moreover, unless the      data is aggregated by NSA, it may not be possible to identify      telephony      metadata records that cross different telecommunications      networks. The bulk collection of telephony metadata--i.e. the      collection of a large volume and high percentage of      information about unrelated communications--is therefore      necessary to identify the much smaller subset of terrorist-     related telephony metadata records contained within the data.      It also allows NSA to make connections related to terrorist      activities over time and can assist counterterrorism      personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists      have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in      terrorist activities, including persons and activities inside      the United States. Because the telephony metadata must be      available in bulk to allow NSA to identify the records of      terrorist communications, there are ``reasonable grounds to      believe'' that the data is relevant to an authorized      investigation to protect against international terrorism, as      section 215 requires, even though most of the records in the      dataset are not associated with terrorist activity.       The program is consistent with the Constitution as well as      with the statute. As noted above, the only type of      information acquired under the program is telephony metadata,      not the content of any communications, not the identity,      address or financial information of any party to the      communication, and not geolocational information. Under      longstanding Supreme Court precedent, there is no reasonable      expectation of privacy with respect to this kind of      information that individuals have already provided to third-     party businesses, and such information therefore is not      protected by the Fourth Amendment.

There has been a top-to-bottom transformation at the FBI moving it from a pure law enforcement agency to a national security agency. Chief among those lending this transformation has been FBI Director Robert Mueller. Sworn in as Director just 1 week prior to 9/11, Director Mueller has led the charge to ensure that the FBI is updated into a modern national security agency. This transformation includes upgrading the workforce from an agent-driven model to one that includes an ever-increasing number of intelligence analysts. Director Mueller has taken the transformation head-on and has done an admirable job. I applaud the hard work that has been done, but more work remains. That is why we are here today introducing legislation that will extend the term of FBI Director Mueller for 2 additional years. I join my colleagues from the Judiciary and Select Intelligence Committees in introducing a one-time statutory exemption that will extend the term of FBI Director Mueller's term by 2 years. I do this recognizing the good work of Director Mueller and against a backdrop of heightened alert to terrorist attack following the death of Osama bin Laden. However, I do this with a heavy heart because I believe the 10-year term is a good thing for both the FBI and the country.",

        "statement": "Dear Senators Reid and McConnell, We write to urge you to      bring cyber security legislation to the floor as soon as      possible. Given the time left in this legislative session and      the upcoming election this fall, we are concerned that the      window of opportunity to pass legislation that is in our view      critically necessary to protect our national and economic      security is quickly disappearing.       We have spoken a number of times in recent months on the      cyber threat--that it is imminent, and that it represents one      of the most serious challenges to our national security since      the onset of the nuclear age sixty years ago. It appears that      this message has been received by many in Congress--and yet      we still await conclusive legislative action.       We support the areas that have been addressed so far, most      recently in the House: the importance of strengthening the      security of the federal government's computer networks,      investing in cyber research and development, and fostering      information sharing about cyber threats and vulnerabilities      across government agencies and with the private sector. We      urge the Senate to now keep the ball moving forward in these      areas by bringing legislation to the floor as soon as      possible.       In addition, we also feel that protection of our critical      infrastructure is essential in order to effectively protect      our national and economic security from the growing cyber      threat. Infrastructure that controls our electricity, water      and sewer, nuclear plants, communications backbone, energy      pipelines and financial networks must be required to meet      appropriate cyber security standards. Where market forces and      existing regulations have failed to drive appropriate      security, we believe that our government must do what it can      to ensure the protection of our critical infrastructure.      Performance standards in some cases will be necessary--these      standards should be technology neutral, and risk and outcome      based. We do not believe that this requires the imposition of      detailed security regimes in every instance, but some      standards must be minimally required or promoted through the      offer of positive incentives such as liability protection and      availability of clearances.       Various drafts of legislation have attempted to address      this important area--the Lieberman/Collins bill having      received the most traction until recently. We will not      advocate one approach over another--however, we do feel      strongly that critical infrastructure protection needs to be      addressed in any cyber security legislation. The risk is      simply too great considering the reality of our      interconnected and interdependent world, and the impact that      can result from the failure of even one part of the network      across a wide range of physical, economic and social systems.       Finally, we have commented previously about the important      role that the National Security Agency (NSA) can and does      play in the protection of our country against cyber threats.      A piece of malware sent from Asia to the United States could      take as little as 30 milliseconds to traverse such distance.      Preventing and defending against such attacks requires the      ability to respond to them in real-time. NSA is the only      agency dedicated to breaking the codes and understanding the      capabilities and intentions of potential enemies, even before      they hit ``send.'' Any legislation passed by Congress should      allow the public and private sectors to harness the      capabilities of the NSA to protect our critical      infrastructure from malicious actors.       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been      averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do      not want to be in the same position again when `cyber 9/11'      hits--it is not a question of `whether' this will happen; it      is a question of `when.'        Therefore we urge you to bring cyber security legislation      to the floor as soon as possible.           Sincerely,     Hon. Michael Chertoff,     Hon. J. Mike McConnell,     Hon. Paul Wolfowitz,     Gen. Michael Hayden,     Gen. James Cartwright (RET),     Hon. William Lynn III.",

        "statement": "(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The central provision of the FISA Amendments of 2008      (Public Law 110-261; 122 Stat. 2436) enacted section 702 of      the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C.      1881a) which provides the government authority to collect the      communications of persons reasonably believed to be citizens      of foreign countries who are located outside the United      States.       (2) Such section 702 contained restrictions regarding the      acquisition of the communications of United States persons      which were intended to protect the privacy of United States      persons and prevent intelligence agencies from using the      authority in such section to deliberately read or listen to      the communications of specific United States persons without      obtaining a warrant or emergency authorization to do so.       (3) Estimating the total number of communications to or      from the United States collected under the authority in such      section 702 would provide an indication of the degree to      which collection carried out under such section has impacted      the privacy of United States persons.       (4) Estimating the number of wholly domestic communications      collected under the authority in such section 702 would      provide a particularly significant indication of the degree      to which collection carried out under this authority has      impacted the privacy of United States persons.       (5) While Congress did not intend to provide authority in      such section 702 for elements of the intelligence community      to deliberately review the communications of specific United      States persons without obtaining individual warrants or      emergency authorizations to do so, such section 702 does not      include a specific prohibition against this action, and the      people of the United States have a right to know whether      elements of the intelligence community have deliberately      searched through communications collected under such section      702 to find the communications of specific United States      persons.       (6) Despite requests from numerous Senators, the Director      of National Intelligence has declined to state publicly      whether--       (A) any entity has made an estimate of the number of United      States communications that have been collected under such      section 702;       (B) any wholly domestic communications have been collected      under such section 702; or       (C) any element of the intelligence community has attempted      to search through communications collected under such section      702 in a deliberate effort to review the communications of a      specific United States person without obtaining a warrant or      emergency authorization permitting such a search.       (7) In public remarks in July 2012, the Director of the      National Security Agency stated that ``the story that we have      millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is      absolutely false''.       (b) Report.--       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Director of National      Intelligence shall submit to Congress a report on the impact      of the amendments made by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008      (Public Law 110-261; 122 Stat. 2436) and other surveillance      authorities on the privacy of United States persons.       (2) Content.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall      include the following:       (A) A determination of whether any government entity has      produced any estimate regarding--       (i) the total number of communications that--       (I) originated from or were directed to a location in the      United States; and       (II) have been collected under the authority of section 702      of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50      U.S.C. 1881a); or       (ii) the total number of wholly domestic communications      that have been collected under such authority.       (B) If any estimate described in subparagraph (A) was      produced, such estimate.       (C) An assessment of whether any wholly domestic      communications have been collected under the authority of      section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1881a).       (D) A determination of whether any element of the      intelligence community has ever attempted to search through      communications collected under section 702 of the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1881a) in a      deliberate effort to find the communications of a specific      United States person, without obtaining a warrant or      emergency authorization to do so.       (E) A determination of whether the National Security Agency      has collected any type of personally identifiable data      pertaining to more than 1,000,000 United States persons.       (c) Form of Report.--       (1) Public availability of report.--The report required by      subsection (b) shall be made available to the public not      later than 15 days after the date such report is submitted to      Congress.       (2) Redactions.--If the President believes that public      disclosure of information in the report required by      subsection (b) could cause significant harm to national      security, the President may redact such information from the      report made available to the public.       (3) Submission to congress.--If the President redacts      information under paragraph (2), not later than 30 days after      the date the report required by subsection (b) is made      available to the public under paragraph (1), the President      shall submit to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the      Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of      the House of Representatives a statement explaining the      specific harm to national security that the disclosure of      such information could cause.",

We need to engage the rest of the world, including Iran and Syria, through diplomacy, trade, and travel rather than pass threatening legislation like this that paves the way to war. We have seen the limitations of force as a tool of U.S. foreign policy. It is time to try a more traditional and conservative approach. I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.",

        "statement": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Northern Virginia Community College. Over the past two decades, the National Capital Region, especially Northern Virginia, has experienced explosive growth, becoming one of the most economically vibrant and diverse regions in the country. Northern Virginia Community College has been a major contributing factor to this success.   Established in 1964 under the name Northern Virginia Technical College, the school opened with 761 students in a single building in Bailey's Crossroads. Renamed in 1966, Northern Virginia Community College, known locally as NOVA, now serves more than 100,000 full and part-time students at six campuses and three satellite educational centers, and through online learning.   NOVA graduates who receive passing grades in designated courses are guaranteed admission to more than 40 area four-year colleges and universities. An in-state student can save approximately $15,000, or 30% of tuition and fees, for a baccalaureate degree by attending NOVA for two years and then transferring to a public four-year institution. High school students can take advantage of this opportunity beginning at age 16.   It is the largest public educational institution in Virginia and the second-largest community college in the United States. It is also one of the most internationally diverse colleges in the nation, with 20% of the student population consisting of individuals from more than 180 countries. Nearly 4,000 faculty and staff members serve the students and the broader community. Nearly 300,000 individuals attend community activities on NOVA campuses each year.   NOVA offers a wide variety of programs that support academic achievement and personal growth, and that promote civic engagement, leadership development, community involvement, health  wellness, and culture. Dozens of student-led organizations enrich campus life and specialized populations such as the disabled or current and former members of the military receive services tailored to their unique circumstances.   Our local economy and our nation's security have benefitted from NOVA's innovative workforce development programs and cybersecurity curricula. Employers can rely on new-hires with credentials from NOVA and can partner with NOVA to develop customized training solutions so that recent graduates or current employees possess cutting edge skills required to succeed in a dynamic economy. The National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security have designated NOVA as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance, and representatives from the intelligence community routinely recruit graduates with an Associate of Applied Science degree in Cybersecurity from NOVA.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating NOVA on 50 years of delivering world-class post-secondary education and workforce development to ensure our region and the Commonwealth of Virginia continue to have such a highly-educated population and a globally competitive workforce. NOVA truly exemplifies the crucial role that publicly-supported higher education plays in our society. I look forward to seeing what NOVA will accomplish in the next 50 years.",

Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) on Friday called for      action on a bill bolstering power-grid cybersecurity after a      Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said the      Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is trying to hack      American electrical power companies.       ``No solace should be taken in the fact that ISIS has been      unsuccessful,'' Jackson Lee said. ``ISIS need only be      successful once to have catastrophic impact on regional      electricity supply.''       Caitlin Durkovich, assistant secretary for infrastructure      protection at DHS, told energy firm executives at an industry      conference in Philadelphia last week that ISIS ``is beginning      to perpetrate cyberattacks.''       Law enforcement officials speaking at the same event      indicated that the group's efforts have so far been      unsuccessful, thanks in part to a Balkanized power grid and      an unsophisticated approach.       ``Strong intent. Thankfully, low capability,'' said John      Riggi, a section chief at the FBI's cyber division. ``But the      concern is that they'll buy that capability.''       Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Homeland Security      Committee and ranking member on the Judiciary Committee's      Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and      Investigations, in January introduced the Terrorism      Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.       The bill directs DHS to work with critical infrastructure      companies to boost their cyber defenses against terrorist      attacks, part of a swath of legislation that has attempted to      codify the agency's responsibilities in that area.       Late last year, the Senate passed its version of the House-     passed National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure      Protection Act.       The bill officially authorized an already-existing      cybersecurity information-sharing hub at DHS.       Although a deadly attack on power plants or the electric      grid--a ``cyber Pearl Harbor''--is still only a hypothetical,      experts warn critical infrastructure sites are increasingly      at risk, as electric grids get smarter.       National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers told      lawmakers last fall that China and ``one or two'' other      countries would be able to shut down portions of critical      U.S. infrastructure with a cyberattack. Researchers suspect      Iran to be on that list.       In August, DHS announced the creation of a new subcommittee      dedicated to preventing attacks on the power grid.       The new panel is tasked with identifying how well the      department's lifeline sectors are prepared to meet threats      and recover from a significant cyber event.       The committee will also provide recommendations for a more      unified approach to state and local cybersecurity.       ``There is a great deal that has been done and is being      done now to secure our networks,'' Homeland Security      Secretary Jeh Johnson told the House Judiciary Committee in      July. ``There is more to do.''",

The mission of US-CERT is simple, I think: to make the Internet a safer place for everyone by helping to improve cyber security across the country. I will say that again. The mission of US-CERT is very simple--not easy but simple. It is to make the Internet a safer place for everyone by helping to improve cyber security across our country. To do this, US-CERT operates a wide variety of programs. These programs include several information sharing collaboration programs, incident response teams that provide onsite assistance to attack victims, programs such as the EINSTEIN intrusion detection and prevention system to protect Federal agencies, education and awareness programs, and deeply technical forensic analysis. The US-CERT partners with a wide variety of organizations. Among them, they partner with powerplants and utilities, they partner with financial institutions, they partner with software companies, with researchers, and they partner with certain teams in other countries and other cyber operation centers such as those over at NSA, the National Security Agency, and the FBI as well.",

        "statement": "Washington.--Justice Department watchdogs ran into an      unexpected roadblock last year when they began examining the      role of federal drug agents in the fatal shootings of unarmed      civilians during raids in Honduras.       The Drug Enforcement Administration balked at turning over      emails from senior officials tied to the raids, according to      the department's inspector general. It took nearly a year of      wrangling before the D.E.A. was willing to turn over all its      records in a case that the inspector general said raised      ``serious questions'' about agents' use of deadly force.       The continuing Honduran inquiry is one of at least 20      investigations across the government that have been slowed,      stymied or      sometimes closed because of a long-simmering dispute between      the Obama administration and its own watchdogs over the      shrinking access of inspectors general to confidential      records, according to records and interviews.       The impasse has hampered investigations into an array of      programs and abuse reports--from allegations of sexual      assaults in the Peace Corps to the F.B.I.'s terrorism powers,      officials said. And it has threatened to roll back more than      three decades of policy giving the watchdogs unfettered      access to ``all records'' in their investigations.       ``The bottom line is that we're no longer independent,''      Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector      general, said in an interview.       The restrictions reflect a broader effort by the Obama      administration to prevent unauthorized disclosures of      sensitive information--at the expense, some watchdogs insist,      of government oversight.       Justice Department lawyers concluded in a legal opinion      this summer that some protected records, like grand jury      transcripts, wiretap intercepts and financial credit reports,      could be kept off limits to government investigators. The      administration insists there is no intention of curtailing      investigations, but both Democrats and Republicans in      Congress have expressed alarm and are promising to restore      full access to the watchdogs.       The new restrictions grew out of a five-year-old dispute      within the Justice Department. After a series of scathing      reports by Glenn Fine, then the Justice Department inspector      general, on F.B.I. abuses in counterterrorism programs,      F.B.I. lawyers began asserting in 2010 that he could no      longer have access to certain confidential records because      they were legally protected.       That led to a series of high-level Justice Department      reviews, a new procedure for reviewing records requests and,      ultimately, a formal opinion in July from the department's      Office of Legal Counsel. That opinion, which applies to      federal agencies across the government, concluded that the      1978 law giving an inspector general access to ``all      records'' in investigations did not necessarily mean all      records when it came to material like wiretap intercepts and      grand jury reports.       The inspector-general system was created in 1978 in the      wake of Watergate as an independent check on government      abuse, and it has grown to include watchdogs at 72 federal      agencies. Their investigations have produced thousands of      often searing public reports on everything from secret      terrorism programs and disaster responses to boondoggles like      a lavish government conference in Las Vegas in 2010 that      featured a clown and a mind reader.       Not surprisingly, tensions are common between the watchdogs      and the officials they investigate. President Ronald Reagan,      in fact, fired 15 inspectors general in 1981. But a number of      scholars and investigators said the restrictions imposed by      the Obama administration reflect a new level of acrimony.       ``This is by far the most aggressive assault on the      inspector general concept since the beginning,'' said Paul      Light, a New York University professor who has studied the      system. ``It's the complete evisceration of the concept. You      might as well fold them down. They've become defanged.''       While President Obama has boasted of running ``the most      transparent administration in history,'' some watchdogs say      the clampdown has scaled back scrutiny of government      programs.       ``This runs against transparency,'' said the Peace Corps      inspector general, Kathy Buller.       At the Peace Corps, her office began running into problems      two years ago in an investigation into the agency's handling      of allegations of sexual assaults against overseas      volunteers. Congress mandated a review after a volunteer in      Benin was murdered in 2009; several dozen volunteers reported      that the Peace Corps ignored or mishandled sexual abuse      claims.       But Peace Corps lawyers initially refused to turn over      abuse reports, citing privacy restrictions. Even after      reaching an agreement opening up some material, Ms. Buller      said investigators have been able to get records that are      heavily redacted.       ``It's been incredibly frustrating,'' she said. ``We have      spent so much time and energy arguing with the agency over      this issue.''       The Peace Corps said in a statement, however, that it was      committed to ``rigorous oversight'' and has cooperated fully      with the inspector general.       Agencies facing investigations are now sometimes relying on      the Justice Department's opinion as justification for denying      records--even records that are not specifically covered in      the opinion, officials said.       At the Commerce Department, the inspector general this year      shut down an internal audit of enforcement of international      trade agreements because the department's lawyers, citing the      Justice Department's guidance, refused to turn over business      records that they said were ``proprietary'' and protected.       The Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general has      reported a series of struggles with the organization over its      access to documents, including records the agency said were      classified or covered by attorney-client privilege. And      investigators at the Postal Service, a special Afghanistan      reconstruction board, and other federal agencies have      complained of tightened restrictions on investigative records      as well.       Hopes of a quick end to the impasse have dimmed in recent      days after the Obama administration volunteered to restore      full access for the Justice Department's inspector general--     but not the other 71 watchdogs.       Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, asked about the issue at      a House hearing last week, said the proposal was intended to      ensure, at least at the Justice Department, ``that the      inspector general would receive all the information he      needed.''       But watchdogs outside the Justice Department said they      would be left dependent on the whims of agency officials in      their investigations.       ``It's no fix at all,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley,      Republican of Iowa, who leads the Judiciary Committee.       In a rare show of bipartisanship, the administration has      drawn scorn from Democrats and Republicans. The Obama      administration's stance has ``blocked what was once a free      flow of information'' to the watchdogs, Senator Patrick J.      Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary      Committee, said at a hearing.       A Justice Department spokeswoman, Emily Pierce, said in a      statement on Friday: ``Justice Department leadership has      issued policy guidance to ensure that our inspector general      gets the documents he requests as quickly as possible, even      when those documents are protected by other statutes      protecting sensitive information. The department is unaware      of any instance in which the inspector general has sought      access to documents or information protected from disclosure      by statute and did not receive them.''       Nowhere has the fallout over the dispute been felt more      acutely than at the Justice Department, where the inspector      general's office said 14 investigations had been hindered by      the restricted access.       These include investigations into the F.B.I.'s use of phone      records collected by the National Security Agency, the      government's sharing of intelligence information before the      2013 Boston Marathon bombings, a notorious gun-tracing      operation known as ``Fast and Furious'' and the deadly      Honduran drug raids.       In the case of the Honduran raids, the inspector general      has been trying to piece together the exact role of D.E.A.      agents in participating in, or even leading, a series of      controversial drug raids there beginning in 2011.       Details of what happened remain sketchy even today, but      drug agents in a helicopter in 2012 reportedly killed four      unarmed villagers in a boat, including a pregnant woman and a      14-year-old boy, during a raid on suspected drug smugglers in      northeastern Honduras. They also shot down several private      planes--suspected of carrying drugs--in possible violation of      international law.       An investigation by the Honduran government cleared      American agents of responsibility. But when the inspector      general began examining the case last year, D.E.A. officials      refused to turn over emails on the episodes from senior      executives, the inspector general's office said. Only after      more than 11 months of back-and-forth negotiations were all      the records turned over.       The D.E.A. refused to comment on the case, citing the      investigation. A senior Justice Department official, speaking      on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing      review, said the refusal to turn over the records was the      flawed result of ``a culture within the D.E.A.'' at the      time--and not the result of the Justice Department's new      legal restrictions.       Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general, said the long delay      was a significant setback to his investigation. He now hopes      to complete the Honduran review early next year.       In the meantime, the watchdogs say they are looking to      Congress to intervene in a dispute with the administration      that has become increasingly messy.       ``It's essential to enshrine in the law that the inspector      general has access to all agency records,'' said Mr. Fine,      who is now the Pentagon's principal deputy inspector general.      ``The underlying principle is key: To be an effective      inspector general, you need the right to receive timely      access to all agency records.''",

Such assessment shall also--       (1) assess vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the      information processing system, including but not limited to,      microcircuits, software, and firmware;       (2) prioritize the potential vulnerabilities and impacts of      the various elements and stages of the system supply chain to      identify the most effective balance of investments to      minimize the effects of compromise;        (3) provide recommendations regarding ways to improve trust      in the supply chain for covered acquisition programs; and       (4) identify the appropriate lead, and supporting elements,      within the Department of Defense for the development of an      integrated strategy for ensuring trust in the supply chain      for acquisition programs.

Such strategy shall--       (1) address the vulnerabilities identified by the      Secretary's assessment under subsection (a);       (2) reflect the priorities identified by such assessment;       (3) be executable by the defense acquisition community; and       (4) be sufficiently specific to provide guidance for the      planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process in      order to ensure acquisition programs have the necessary      resources to implement all appropriate elements of the      strategy.

(2) The terms ``trust'' and ``trusted'' refer to the high      confidence by the Department of Defense in the national      ability to secure national security systems by assessing the      integrity of the people and processes used to design,      generate, manufacture, and distribute national security      critical components.       (3) The term ``covered trusted systems'' means--       (A) all Mission Assurance Category I systems, as defined in      Department of Defense Directive 8500.01E and associated      Department of Defense Instruction 8500.2; and       (B) any other system identified by the Secretary of Defense      as a system--       (i) that is vital to mission effectiveness or operational      readiness of deployed or contingency forces;       (ii) the loss or degradation of which results in immediate      and sustained loss of mission effectiveness;       (iii) that is highly accurate and highly available; and       (iv) for which the most stringent protection measures are      required.       (4) The term ``trusted foundry services'' means the program      co-funded by the National Security Agency and the Department      of Defense, through program element 0605140D8Z, or any such      similar program approved by the Secretary of Defense.",

        "statement": "The National Security Agency collects, processes and      disseminates foreign Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). The old      adage that ``knowledge is power'' has perhaps never been      truer than when applied to today's threats against our nation      and the role SIGINT plays in overcoming them.       NSA's SIGINT mission protects the nation by:       Providing information in the form of SIGINT products and      services that enable our government to make critical      decisions and operate successfully.       Protecting the rights of U.S. citizens by adhering to the      provisions of the 4th amendment to the Constitution.       Using the nation's resources responsibly, according to the      best management processes available.       SIGINT is derived from the signals environment that is      described by the graphic above. Other agencies within the      Intelligence Community are responsible for other types of      intelligence:       Human Intelligence (HUMINT) is primarily the responsibility      of the CIA and DIA,       Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) belongs to NGA,        Military Intelligence and Measurement and Signature      Intelligence (MASINT) belongs to DIA.       Together, these different yet complementary disciplines      give our nation's leaders a greater understanding of the      intentions of our enemies.       NSA's SIGINT mission provides our military leaders and      policy makers with intelligence to ensure our national      defense and to advance U.S. global interests. This      information is specifically limited to that on foreign      powers, organizations or persons and international      terrorists. NSA responds to requirements levied by      intelligence customers, which includes all departments and      levels of the United States Executive Branch.       The prosecution of the SIGINT mission has evolved from the      relatively static, industrial age, Cold War communications      environment to the ubiquitous, high speed, multi-functional      technologies of today's information age. The ever-increasing      volume, velocity and variety of today's communications make      the production of relevant and timely intelligence for      military commanders and national policy makers more      challenging than ever.       NSA has a strong tradition of dedicated, highly qualified      people deeply committed to maintaining the nation's security.      While technology will obviously continue to be a key element      of our future, NSA recognizes that technology is only as good      as the people creating it and the people using it. NSA      remains committed to its core mission of exploiting the      Agency's deep analytical skill and technological capabilities      to ensure the nation maintains a significant strategic      advantage in the advancement of U.S. interests around the      world.       As much as modem telecommunications technology poses      significant challenges to SIGINT, the many languages used in      the nations and regions of the world that are of interest to      our military and national leaders require NSA to maintain a      wide variety of language capabilities. Successful SIGINT      depends on the skills of not only language professionals but      those of mathematicians, analysts, and engineers, as well.      The nation is indebted to them for the successes they have      won.       SIGINT plays a vital role in our national security by      employing the right people and using the latest technology to      provide America's leaders with the critical information they      need to save lives, defend democracy, and promote American      values.",

Hayden, on April 20, 2005, requesting any documentation      related to Mr. Bolton's requests for the identity of a U.S.      person included in classified intelligence reports produced      by the NSA.       In response, General Hayden provided Chairman Pat Roberts      and me the opportunity to review all ten NSA documents      containing the references to U.S. persons that generated Mr.      Bolton's requests. We were not permitted to retain these      intelligence reports and other members of our Committee were      not permitted access to them. Additionally, the actual U.S.      identities provided by the NSA to Mr. Bolton were not shared      with us.       State Department records indicate that Mr. Bolton requested      the minimized identities of nineteen U.S. persons contained      in ten NSA signals intelligence reports. These requests were      processed by the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence      and Research (INR). In each instance, the INR request to the      NSA, on behalf of Mr. Bolton, included the justification that      the identity of the U.S. person(s) was needed in order to      better understand or assess the foreign intelligence value of      the information contained in the intelligence report. This is      the standard justification required by NSA in order for      officials to request the identity of a U.S. person contained      in a signals intelligence report.       Based on my personal review of these reports and the      context in which U.S. persons are referenced in them, I found      no evidence that there was anything improper about Mr.      Bolton's ten requests for the identities of U.S. persons.       It is important to note, however, that our Committee did      not interview Mr. Bolton, so I am unable to answer directly      the question of why he felt it was necessary for him to have      the identity information in order to better understand the      foreign intelligence contained in the report.       Furthermore, based on the information available to me, I do      not have a complete understanding of Mr. Bolton's handling of      the identity information after he received it.       The Committee has learned during its interview of Mr.      Frederick Fleitz, Mr. Bolton's acting Chief of Staff, that on      at least one occasion Mr. Bolton is alleged to have shared      the un-minimized identity information he received from the      NSA with another individual in the State Department. In this      instance, the NSA memorandum forwarding the requested      identity to State INR included the following restriction:      ``Request no further action be taken on this information      without prior approval of NSA.'' I have confirmed with the      NSA that the phrase ``no further action'' includes sharing      the requested identity of U.S. persons with any individual      not authorized by the NSA to receive the identity.       In addition to being troubled that Mr. Bolton may have      shared U.S. person identity information without required NSA      approval, I am concerned that the reason for sharing the      information is was not in keeping with Mr. Bolton's requested      justification for the identity in the first place. The      identity information was provided to Mr. Bolton based on the      stated reason that he needed to know the identity in order to      better understand the foreign intelligence contained in the      NSA report. According to Mr. Fleitz, Mr. Bolton used the      information he was provided in one instance in order to seek      out the State Department official mentioned in the report to      congratulate him. This use of carefully minimized U.S. person      identity information seems to be not in keeping with the      rationale provided in Mr. Bolton's request.       An interview of Mr. Bolton by your Committee may provide a      more complete understanding of the extent to which he may      have shared with others the nineteen U.S. person identities      he requested and received from the NSA. I believe it is a      matter that deserves more thorough attention.       I hope this information is of assistance to you.           Sincerely,                                           John D. Rockefeller IV,                                                    Vice Chairman.",

        "statement": "Dear Administrator Bolden: Earlier this year, I invited you      to meet with an impressive group of Chinese human rights      activists in my office. I appreciated your willingness to sit      with them and hear their stories. As you witnessed, to a      person, each loved their country and were rightly proud of      their heritage. But all sought fundamental change. They      longed to live in a land where they could worship freely,      speak openly and enjoy the basic protections of a      constitution grounded in rule of law.       Their quarrel--and mine--is with the thin layer of      leadership at the helm of the Chinese communist party that      rules by fear and oppression. China's repression knows no      boundaries: the government has been a major arms supplier and      source of economic strength to the regime in Khartoum, Sudan,      headed by an internationally indicted war criminal and      architect of the genocide in Darfur. The Chinese people know      that such leadership is destined for the ash heap of history,      and they long for the U.S. government, to find common cause      with the Chinese people not with those who persecute them.       Few in Congress have done more to advocate for the Chinese      people than me.       As co-chairman of the House's bipartisan Human Rights      Commission, I have worked closely with many victims of      repression. I have spent hours with countless Chinese      dissidents ranging from legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, who      escaped from house arrest seeking asylum in the U.S. embassy,      to Uyghur Muslim activist Rebiya Kadeer, herself a political      dissident, to house church pastor and advocate Bob Fu, to      former laogai prisoner Harry Wu. I have traveled to China to      meet with human rights and religious freedom activists      oppressed by Beijing. In 1997, I slipped into Tibet with a      trekking group to meet with Buddhist monks and nuns living      under the repressive watch of Chinese security agents. They      showed me forbidden pictures of the Dalai Lama. In 2008, I      returned to China the week before the start of the Olympics      to meet with a group of activists and pastors--all but one      was arrested on their way to the meeting.       The Chinese people are good people who yearn for freedom      and the same universal human rights that we in the West      enjoy, including freedom of speech and religion. In contrast,      the Chinese government is fundamentally corrupt and      systematically abuses the basic human rights of its own      people. We only need to ask the Catholic bishop under house      arrest, the house church pastor languishing in prison, the      Tibetan monk willing to set himself aflame in desperation      at the abuses suffered by his people to know this is true.       Consider that at the same time that the 2010 Nobel Prize      recipient Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident, was jailed, the      2009 Nobel Prize winner, President Obama, was hosting a state      dinner for Chinese premier Hu Jintao. No such welcome was      afforded to the Dalai Lama during his first visit to      Washington during Obama's presidency. Much like Solzhenitsyn      before him the Dalai Lama was denied an audience with the      president because the White House didn't want to there to be      any impact on the president's trip to Beijing the next month.       These events, coupled with former Secretary of State      Hillary Clinton's comments during an early visit to Asia, in      which she famously said that U.S concern with human rights      issues in China ``can't interfere with the global economic      crisis, the global climate change crisis, and the security      crisis,'' have sadly set the tone for this administration.      Too often, the Obama Administration has willfully turned a      blind eye towards human rights abuses as well as systemic      Internet censorship, crackdowns on free speech and protestors      and prolific theft of intellectual property all in the name      of currying favor with the Chinese government.       In light of these realities, I have supported efforts to      limit new collaboration with China until we see improvements      in its human rights record, as well as a reduction in its      well documented cyberattacks and espionage efforts against      the U.S. My record on this has been clear and well      publicized, especially with regard to language I have      included in legislation affecting NASA and other agencies.      However, I was concerned to read an October 4 article in The      Guardian that reported on poor guidance about these policies      with regard to restrictions on Chinese nationals      attending a conference next month at NASA Ames Research      Center. Unfortunately, the article is riddled with      inaccuracies, as is, it appears, the guidance provided by      NASA Ames staff to the attendees.       According to the article: ``Chinese applicants were told      they could not attend the conference in an email sent by Mark      Messersmith, a Kepler project specialist at Nasa Ames.      `Unfortunately . . . federal legislation passed last March      forbids us from hosting any citizens of the People's Republic      of China at a conference held at facilities of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration. Regarding those who are      already working at other institutions in the US, due to      security issues resulting from recent Congressional actions,      they are under the same constraints' according to the email,      seen by the Guardian.''       As you know, the congressional provision--which has been in      place since early 2011--primarily restricts bilateral, not      multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist      Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies. It places no      restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese      nationals unless those nationals are acting as official      representatives of the Chinese government. As such, the email      from NASA Ames mischaracterizes the law and is inaccurate.       I believe what Mr. Messersmith may have been referring to      was a temporary restriction on Chinese nationals that you put      in place earlier this year after serious security protocol      flaws were brought to your attention by some in Congress,      including me, specifically regarding violations at Ames and      Langley Research Center. You indicated at the time that      security policies for foreign nationals for particular      countries of concern would be reevaluated and new      accreditations would not be approved until the security      process was vetted. However, any restriction against Chinese      nationals on NASA centers is entirely an agency policy and      not covered under the statutory restriction. Furthermore, it      was my understanding that NASA's temporary restrictions had      been lifted after a review of security protocols for foreign      nationals at all NASA centers.       As you know, NASA's inspector general recently produced a      report documenting the serious failures in the security      process that led to violations involving a Chinese national      at NASA's Langley Research Center. I hope a copy of this      report will soon be made public. For these reasons, I      supported NASA's policies that were put in place earlier this      year to ensure that these security flaws had been dealt with.      I continue to support every effort you deem appropriate to      ensure that NASA centers are fully compliant with laws and      regulations governing security.       However, it is clear the NASA Ames guidance provided to      conference attendees was inaccurate and not reflective of the      statutory restrictions enacted by Congress. NASA headquarters      needs to send updated guidance to both the conference      attendees and to the press to correct this misconception.       That said, I was struck by comments from individuals quoted      in the Guardian article who indicated their intent to boycott      this conference. How many of these same people are all too      willing to participate in science conferences in China that      are hosted and paid for by the autocratic Chinese government,      with its clear and undisputed record of abuses and      censorship? Which begs the question, where then was their      righteous outrage?       According to the article, ``Geoff Marcy, an astronomy      professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has      been tipped to win a Nobel prize for his pioneering work on      exoplanets, or planets outside the solar system, called the      ban `completely shameful and unethical.' In an email sent to      the conference organizers, Marcy said: `In good conscience, I      cannot attend a meeting that discriminates in this way. The      meeting is about planets located trillions of miles away,      with no national security implications,' he wrote. `It is      completely unethical for the United States of America to      exclude certain countries from pure science research,' Marcy      told the Guardian. `It's an ethical breach that is      unacceptable. You have to draw the line.' ''       Again, while the conference guidance provided by Ames was      inaccurate, I hope Dr. Marcy will draw a similar line when it      comes to cooperation with Chinese government funded agencies      and programs due to their systemic human rights abuses. In      fact, as a Nobel nominee himself, has he publicly advocated      for the 2010 Nobel Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo who to this day      languishes in Chinese detention?       In the powerful words of the Nobel Committee which      asserted, in awarding the prize to Liu, that ``there is a      close connection between human rights and peace . . .'' The      Committee continued, ``The campaign to establish universal      human rights also in China is being waged by many Chinese,      both in China itself and abroad. Through the severe      punishment meted out to him, Liu has become the foremost      symbol of this wide-ranging struggle for human rights in      China.'' Will the international science community stand      with those who are struggling for human rights in China?      Will they take a similarly public stand against the      ``shameful'' and ``unethical'' activities of the Chinese      government which our own State Department characterizes as      an ``authoritarian state'' which routinely engages in      ``repression and coercion'' and resorts to ``extralegal      measures such as enforced disappearance, `soft detention,'      and strict house arrest, including house arrest of family      members, to prevent the public voicing of independent      opinions''?       Given the attention raised in the Guardian article about      the statutory restrictions on bilateral relations with the      Chinese government, it is worth recalling why the Congress      has deemed it appropriate to put these provisions in statute      since 2011. In addition to the myriad human rights and      religious freedom abuses described above, there are serious      concerns about widespread espionage against the U.S.,      including NASA, as well as recent developments in China's      space warfare program.       Over the last year, there has been much discussion about      the unprecedented espionage campaign run by the People's      Liberation Army (PLA) against the U.S. government--including      NASA--and industry. The director of National Security Agency      recently described Chinese espionage of U.S. technology as      ``the greatest transfer of wealth in history.''       Other senior U.S. military and intelligence officials have      become increasingly vocal about their concerns about the      scope of Chinese espionage and cyberattacks. Defense      Intelligence Agency chief General Ron Burgess testified last      year that ``China has used its intelligence services to      gather information via a significant network of agents and      contacts using a variety of methods . . . In recent years,      multiple cases of economic espionage and theft of dual-use      and military technology have uncovered pervasive Chinese      collection efforts.''       The evidence of prolific Chinese cyperattacks and espionage      have become increasingly clear with the release of the      Mandiant report in February as well as the newspapers that      have come forward to report targeted attacks from China based      on reporting critical of the Chinese government. Then, in      April, Verizon released its annual cyber report which found      that ``96 percent of recorded, state-affiliated attacks      targeting business' trade secrets and other intellectual      property in 2012 could be traced to Chinese hackers.'' These      are just the latest reports in a series of official documents      that have built a damning case against Chinese cyber      espionage against the U.S. government and industry.       In late 2011, the Office of the National      Counterintelligence Executive released a report for foreign      spies in the U.S. Not surprisingly, much of the report      focused on China's espionage operations. According to the      report, Chinese espionage efforts ``combine collection of      open source information, [human intelligence], signals      intelligence, and cyber operations'' to ``develop a      competitive edge over the United States.'' The report also      explicitly notes that China views itself as a ``strategic      competitor'' of the U.S. and is one of the ``most aggressive      collectors of U.S. economic information and technology.''       It is particularly notable that the president's strategy on      mitigating the theft of U.S. intellectual property      specifically singled out core technologies that NASA      develops, including ``unmanned aerial vehicles, and other      aerospace/aeronautic technologies'' and ``civilian and dual-     use technologies in sectors likely to experience fast      growth'' as information of the greatest interest to Chinese      espionage.       In response to the public attention to the Chinese      espionage threat, earlier this year the White House released      a white paper detailing its strategy to mitigate the theft of      trade secrets. Notably, of the 19 trade secret espionage      cases that have been brought under this administration, 16 of      the 19 cases involved Chinese nationals spying for Chinese      institutions. That's 85 percent of all DOJ espionage cases      that have involved Chinese espionage.       At the same time, the PLA--which runs China's space      program--is developing space weapons to use against U.S.      satellites. According to a recent article from respected      national security reporter Bill Gertz, ``China last week      conducted a test of a maneuvering satellite that captured      another satellite in space during what Pentagon officials say      was a significant step forward for Beijing's space warfare      program. The satellite capture took place last week and      involved one of three small satellites fitted with a      mechanical arm that were launched July 20 as part of a covert      anti-satellite weapons development program, said U.S.      officials familiar with reports of the test.''       The article continued: ``The official said the satellites      are part of China's `Star Wars' space weapon program that has      been largely ignored by the Obama administration over      concerns that pressing China to explain its space weapons      program would upset U.S.-China relations. The ASAT program is      a `real concern for U.S. national defense,' the official      said.''       There is good reason Congress is concerned about providing      the Communist Chinese government with additional      opportunities to work with the U.S. on space given their      continued cyberattacks, espionage campaigns and development      of space weapons to use against the U.S.       Returning to Ames, the misrepresentation of NASA policy      quoted in the Guardian article is the latest in a series of      questionable actions taken by the Ames center leadership that      have resulted in criminal investigations of export violations      and inspector general reviews of illegitimate contracts      issued by the center. I believe the center has become a rat's      nest of inappropriate and possibly illegal activities that      appear to have occurred with the concurrence of the center's      leadership.        In one troubling example, last month, The Wall Street      Journal reported on a Space Act Agreement between Ames and      Google's executives to use taxpayer-subsidized airplane fuel      intended for military aircraft for personal travel by      Google's leadership. A dubious scientific data collection      scheme appears to have been developed as an excuse for this      preferential treatment for these executives.       According to the article, ``The main jets in the fleet--a      Boeing 767, Boeing 757 and four Gulfstream V's--have departed      from Moffett a total of 710 times since 2007, FAA records      show. The most frequent destinations were Los Angeles and New      York, but the planes also flew 20 times to the Caribbean      island of Tortola; 17 to Hawaii; 16 to Nantucket, Mass.; and      15 to Tahiti.'' It would be difficult for anyone to make the      case that these taxpayer-subsidized trips provided any      credible scientific value to NASA.       The article continued: ``In total, [the Google aircraft      holding company] has bought 2.3 million gallons of jet fuel      since early 2009, according to Pentagon records viewed by The      Wall Street Journal, paying an average $3.19 per gallon. `I      don't see how in the hell anybody can buy it that cheap,'      said Fred Fitts, president of the Corporate Aircraft      Association, a nonprofit that negotiates discounted jet-fuel      prices for 1,600 corporate flight departments at airports      around the U.S. Mr. Fitts provided figures showing that CAA      members paid an average of $4.35 a gallon across the U.S.      over that period.''       Although the article noted that this arrangement was      recently terminated, the fact that Ames leadership approved      this sweetheart deal for the Google executives and allowed it      to continue for six years knowing that there was no serious      scientific merit is unacceptable.       In addition to this troubling relationship, I also have      been outspoken about my concerns that a number of Ames staff      were investigated for a number of years by the Federal Bureau      of Investigation (FBI), the NASA Office of the Inspector      General and other law enforcement agencies relating to the      alleged illegal transfer of ITAR-controlled technology by      individuals at the NASA Ames Research Center. It is my      understanding that this illegal technology transfer may have      involved classified Defense Department weapons system      technology to foreign countries.       According to whistleblowers that contacted Congress, large      numbers of foreign nationals were invited to work at NASA      Ames over the last six years and that federal information and      physical security safeguards may not have been used or may      have explicitly been ignored on multiple occasions.      Additionally, my colleagues and I were informed that Ames      staff may have traveled to foreign conferences and      disseminated information about ITAR-controlled technologies      in public forums, with Chinese and other foreign officials      present.       In correspondence that I have seen, the FBI believed it had      a solid case that was ready for prosecution and referred it      to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California.      However, after a series of unexplained delays and the removal      of at least one assistant U.S. attorney working the case, the      charges ran up against the statute of limitations, and the      first charge expired on December 15, 2012. The case was      ultimately declined by the Justice Department for reasons      that have never been explained to the Congress or federal law      enforcement. I believe these inexplicable delays and ultimate      declination was a product of politicization within the      Justice Department, and I have included language in the FY      2014 Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill further      addressing this matter.       Nonetheless, it appears that federal law enforcement felt      there was a solid case against certain Ames staff members      involving export violations. Yet there has been no      accountability at Ames for these alleged criminal violations.      This is inexcusable.       Again, I hope you quickly correct the record and take      appropriate action to inform the conference participants of      NASA's actual policy regarding foreign visitors. I look      forward to your prompt response.       Best wishes.           Sincerely,                                                    Frank R. Wolf,     Member of Congress.",

        "statement": "In June, a stone carver from Manassas chiseled another      perfect star into a marble wall at CIA headquarters, one of      22 for agency workers killed in the global war initiated by      the 2001 terrorist attacks.       The intent of the memorial is to publicly honor the courage      of those who died in the line of duty, but it also conceals a      deeper story about government in the post-9/11 era: Eight of      the 22 were not CIA officers at all. They were private      contractors.       To ensure that the country's most sensitive duties are      carried out only by people loyal above all to the nation's      interest, federal rules say contractors may not perform what      are called ``inherently government functions.'' But they do,      all the time and in every intelligence and counterterrorism      agency, according to a two-year investigation by The      Washington Post.       What started as a temporary fix in response to the      terrorist attacks has turned into a dependency that calls      into question whether the federal workforce includes too many      people obligated to shareholders rather than the public      interest--and whether the government is still in control of      its most sensitive activities. In interviews last week, both      Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and CIA Director Leon      Panetta said they agreed with such concerns.       The Post investigation uncovered what amounts to an      alternative geography of the United States, a Top Secret      America created since 9/11 that is hidden from public view,      lacking in thorough oversight and so unwieldy that its      effectiveness is impossible to determine.       It is also a system in which contractors are playing an      ever more important role. The Post estimates that out of      854,000 people with top-secret clearances, 265,000 are      contractors. There is no better example of the government's      dependency on them than at the CIA, the one place in      government that exists to do things overseas that no other      U.S. agency is allowed to do.       Private contractors working for the CIA have recruited      spies in Iraq, paid bribes for information in Afghanistan and      protected CIA directors visiting world capitals. Contractors      have helped snatch a suspected extremist off the streets of      Italy, interrogated detainees once held at secret prisons      abroad and watched over defectors holed up in the Washington      suburbs. At Langley headquarters, they analyze terrorist      networks. At the agency's training facility in Virginia, they      are helping mold a new generation of American spies.       Through the federal budget process, the George W. Bush      administration and Congress made it much easier for the CIA      and other agencies involved in counterterrorism to hire more      contractors than civil servants. They did this to limit the      size of the permanent workforce, to hire employees more      quickly than the sluggish federal process allows and because      they thought--wrongly, it turned out--that contractors would      be less expensive.       Nine years later, well into the Obama administration, the      idea that contractors cost less has been repudiated, and the      administration has made some progress toward its goal of      reducing the number of hired hands by 7 percent over two      years. Still, close to 30 percent of the workforce in the      intelligence agencies is contractors.       ``For too long, we've depended on contractors to do the      operational work that ought to be done'' by CIA employees,      Panetta said. But replacing them ``doesn't happen overnight.      When you've been dependent on contractors for so long, you      have to build that expertise over time.'' A second concern of      Panetta's: contracting with corporations, whose      responsibility ``is to their shareholders, and that does      present an inherent conflict.''       Or as Gates, who has been in and out of government his      entire life, puts it: ``You want somebody who's really in it      for a career because they're passionate about it and because      they care about the country and not just because of the      money.''       Contractors can offer more money--often twice as much--to      experienced federal employees than the government is allowed      to pay them. And because competition among firms for people      with security clearances is so great, corporations offer such      perks as BMWs and $15,000 signing bonuses, as Raytheon did in      June for software developers with top-level clearances.       The idea that the government would save money on a contract      workforce ``is a false economy,'' said Mark M. Lowenthal, a      former senior CIA official and now president of his own      intelligence training academy.       As companies raid federal agencies of talent, the      government has been left with the youngest intelligence      staffs ever while more experienced employees move into the      private sector. This is true at the CIA, where employees from      114 firms account for roughly a third of the workforce, or      about 10,000 positions. Many of them are temporary hires,      often former military or intelligence agency employees who      left government service to work less and earn more while      drawing a federal pension.       Across the government, such workers are used in every      conceivable way. Contractors kill enemy fighters. They spy on      foreign governments and eavesdrop on terrorist networks. They      help craft war plans. They gather information on local      factions in war zones. They are the historians, the      architects, the recruiters in the nation's most secretive      agencies. They staff watch centers across the Washington      area. They are among the most trusted advisers to the four-     star generals leading the nation's wars.       So great is the government's appetite for private      contractors with top-secret clearances that there are now      more than 300 companies, often nicknamed ``body shops,'' that      specialize in finding candidates, often for a fee that      approaches $50,000 a person, according to those in the      business.       Making it more difficult to replace contractors with      federal employees: The government doesn't know how many are      on the federal payroll. Gates said he wants to reduce the      number of defense contractors by about 13 percent, to pre-9/     11 levels, but he's having a hard time even getting a basic      head count.       ``This is a terrible confession,'' he said. ``I can't get a      number on how many contractors work for the Office of the      Secretary of Defense,'' referring to the department's      civilian leadership.       The Post's estimate of 265,000 contractors doing top-secret      work was vetted by several high-ranking intelligence      officials who approved of The Post's methodology. The      newspaper's Top Secret America database includes 1.931      companies that perform work at the top-secret level. More      than a quarter of them--533--came into being after 2001, and      others that already existed have expanded greatly. Most are      thriving even as the rest of the United States struggles with      bankruptcies, unemployment and foreclosures.       The privatization of national security work has been made      possible by a nine-year ``gusher'' of money, as Gates      recently described national security spending since the 9/11      attacks.       With so much money to spend, managers do not always worry      about whether they are spending it effectively.       ``Someone says, `Let's do another study,' and because no      one shares information, everyone does their own study,'' said      Elena Mastors, who headed a team studying the al-Qaeda      leadership for the Defense Department. ``It's about how many      studies you can orchestrate, how many people you can fly all      over the place. Everybody's just on a spending spree. We      don't need all these people doing all this stuff.''       Most of these contractors do work that is fundamental to an      agency's core mission. As a result, the government has become      dependent on them in a way few could have foreseen: wartime      temps who have become a permanent cadre.       Just last week, typing ``top secret'' into the search      engine of a major jobs Web site showed 1,951 unfilled      positions in the Washington area, and 19,759 nationwide:      ``Target analyst,'' Reston. ``Critical infrastructure      specialist,'' Washington, D.C. ``Joint expeditionary team      member,'' Arlington.       ``We could not perform our mission without them. They serve      as our `reserves,' providing flexibility and expertise we      can't acquire,'' said Ronald Sanders, who was chief of human      capital for the Office of the Director of National      Intelligence before retiring in February. ``Once they are on      board, we treat them as if they're a part of the total      force.''       The Post's investigation is based on government documents      and contracts, job descriptions, property records, corporate      and social networking Web sites, additional records, and      hundreds of interviews with intelligence, military and      corporate officials and former officials. Most requested      anonymity either because they are prohibited from speaking      publicly or because, they said,      they feared retaliation at work for describing their      concerns.       The investigation focused on top-secret work because the      amount classified at the secret level is too large to      accurately track. A searchable database of government      organizations and private companies was built entirely on      public records. [For an explanation of the newspaper's      decision making behind this project, please see the Editor's      Note.]       The national security industry sells the military and      intelligence agencies more than just airplanes, ships and      tanks. It sells contractors' brain power. They advise, brief      and work everywhere, including 25 feet under the Pentagon in      a bunker where they can be found alongside military personnel      in battle fatigues monitoring potential crises worldwide.       Late at night, when the wide corridors of the Pentagon are      all but empty, the National Military Command Center hums with      purpose. There's real-time access to the location of U.S.      forces anywhere in the world, to granular satellite images or      to the White House Situation Room.       The purpose of all this is to be able to answer any      question the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff might      have. To be ready 24 hours a day, every day, takes five      brigadier generals, a staff of colonels and senior      noncommissioned officers--and a man wearing a pink contractor      badge and a bright purple shirt and tie.       Erik Saar's job title is ``knowledge engineer.'' In one of      the most sensitive places in America, he is the only person      in the room who knows how to bring data from far afield,      fast. Saar and four teammates from a private company, SRA      International, teach these top-ranked staff officers to think      in Web 2.0. They are trying to push a tradition-bound culture      to act differently, digitally.       That sometimes means asking for help in a public online      chat room or exchanging ideas on shared Web pages outside the      military computer networks dubbed .mil--things much resisted      within the Pentagon's self-sufficient culture. ``Our job is      to change the perception of leaders who might drive change,''      Saar said.       Since 9/11, contractors have made extraordinary      contributions--and extraordinary blunders--that have changed      history and clouded the public's view of the distinction      between the actions of officers sworn on behalf of the United      States and corporate employees with little more than a      security badge and a gun.       Contractor misdeeds in Iraq and Afghanistan have hurt U.S.      credibility in those countries as well as in the Middle East.      Abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, some of it done by      contractors, helped ignite a call for vengeance against the      United States that continues today. Security guards working      for Blackwater added fuel to the five-year violent chaos in      Iraq and became the symbol of an America run amok.       Contractors in war zones, especially those who can fire      weapons, blur ``the line between the legitimate and      illegitimate use of force, which is just what our enemies      want,'' Allison Stanger, a professor of international      politics and economics at Middlebury College and the author      of ``One Nation Under Contract,'' told the independent      Commission on Wartime Contracting at a hearing in June.       Misconduct happens, too. A defense contractor formerly      called MZM paid bribes for CIA contracts, sending Randy      ``Duke'' Cunningham, who was a California congressman on the      intelligence committee, to prison. Guards employed in      Afghanistan by ArmorGroup North America, a private security      company, were caught on camera in a lewd-partying scandal.       But contractors have also advanced the way the military      fights. During the bloodiest months in Iraq, the founder of      Berico Technologies, a former Army officer named Guy      Filippelli, working with the National Security Agency.      invented a technology that made finding the makers of      roadside bombs easier and helped stanch the number of      casualties from improvised explosives, according to NSA      officials.       Contractors have produced blueprints and equipment for the      unmanned aerial war fought by drones, which have killed the      largest number of senior al-Qaeda leaders and produced a      flood of surveillance videos. A dozen firms created the      transnational digital highway that carries the drones' real-     time data on terrorist hide-outs from overseas to command      posts throughout the United States.       Private firms have become so thoroughly entwined with the      government's most sensitive activities that without them      important military and intelligence missions would have to      cease or would be jeopardized. Some examples:       *At the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the number      of contractors equals the number of federal employees. The      department depends on 318 companies for essential services      and personnel, including 19 staffing firms that help DHS find      and hire even more contractors. At the office that handles      intelligence, six out of 10 employees are from private      industry.       *The National Security Agency, which conducts worldwide      electronic surveillance, hires private firms to come up with      most of its technological innovations. The NSA used to work      with a small stable of firms; now it works with at least 484      and is actively recruiting more.       *The National Reconnaissance Office cannot produce, launch      or maintain its large satellite surveillance systems, which      photograph countries such as China, North Korea and Iran,      without the four major contractors it works with.       *Every intelligence and military organization depends on      contract linguists to communicate overseas, translate      documents and make sense of electronic voice intercepts. The      demand for native speakers is so great, and the amount of      money the government is willing to pay for them is so huge,      that 56 firms compete for this business.       *Each of the 16 intelligence agencies depends on      corporations to set up its computer networks, communicate      with other agencies' networks, and fuse and mine disparate      bits of information that might indicate a terrorist plot.      More than 400 companies work exclusively in this area,      building classified hardware and software systems.       Hiring contractors was supposed to save the government      money. But that has not turned out to be the case. A 2008      study published by the Office of the Director of National      Intelligence found that contractors made up 29 percent of the      workforce in the intelligence agencies but cost the      equivalent of 49 percent of their personnel budgets. Gates      said that federal workers cost the government 25 percent less      than contractors.       The process of reducing the number of contractors has been      slow, if the giant Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland      is any example. There, 2,770 people work on the round-the-     clock maritime watch floor tracking commercial vessels, or in      science and engineering laboratories, or in one of four      separate intelligence centers. But it is the employees of 70      information technology companies who keep the place      operating.       They store, process and analyze communications and      intelligence transmitted to and from the entire U.S. naval      fleet and commercial vessels worldwide. ``Could we keep this      building running without contractors?'' said the captain in      charge of information technology. ``No, I don't think we      could keep up with it.''       Vice Adm. David J. ``Jack'' Dorsett, director of naval      intelligence, said he could save millions each year by      converting 20 percent of the contractor jobs at the Suitland      complex to civil servant positions. He has gotten the go-     ahead, but it's been a slow start. This year, his staff has      converted one contractor job and eliminated another--out of      589. ``It's costing me an arm and a leg,'' Dorsett said.       Washington's corridors of power stretch in a nearly      straight geographical line from the Supreme Court to the      Capitol to the White House. Keep going west, across the      Potomac River, and the unofficial seats of power--the      private, corporate ones--become visible, especially at night.      There in the Virginia suburbs are the brightly illuminated      company logos of Top Secret America: Northrop Grumman, SAIC,      General Dynamics.       Of the 1,931 companies identified by The Post that work on      top-secret contracts, about 110 of them do roughly 90 percent      of the work on the corporate side of the defense-     intelligence-corporate world.       To understand how these firms have come to dominate the      post-9/11 era, there's no better place to start than the      Herndon office of General Dynamics. One recent afternoon      there, Ken Pohill was watching a series of unclassified      images, the first of which showed a white truck moving across      his computer monitor.       The truck was in Afghanistan, and a video camera bolted to      the belly of a U.S. surveillance plane was following it.      Pohill could access a dozen images that might help an      intelligence analyst figure out whether the truck driver was      just a truck driver or part of a network making roadside      bombs to kill American soldiers.       To do this, he clicked his computer mouse. Up popped a      picture of the truck driver's house, with notes about      visitors. Another click. Up popped infrared video of the      vehicle. Click: Analysis of an object thrown from the      driver's side. Click: U-2 imagery. Click: A history of the      truck's movement. Click: A Google Earth map of friendly      forces. Click: A chat box with everyone else following the      truck, too.       Ten years ago, if Pohill had worked for General Dynamics,      he probably would have had a job bending steel. Then, the      company's center of gravity was the industrial port city of      Groton, Conn., where men and women in wet galoshes churned      out submarines, the thoroughbreds of naval warfare. Today,      the firm's commercial core is made up of data tools such as      the digital imagery library in Herndon and the secure      BlackBerry-like device used by President Obama, both      developed at a carpeted suburban office by employees in      loafers and heels.       The evolution of General Dynamics was based on one simple      strategy: Follow the money.       The company embraced the emerging intelligence-driven style      of warfare. It developed small-target identification systems      and equipment that could intercept an insurgent's cellphone      and laptop communications. It found ways to sort the billions      of data points collected by intelligence agencies into piles      of information that a single person could analyze.       It also began gobbling up smaller companies that could help      it dominate the new intelligence landscape, just as its      competitors were doing. Between 2001 and 2010, the company      acquired 11 firms specializing in satellites, signals and      geospatial intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,      technology integration and imagery.       On Sept. 11, 2001, General Dynamics was working with nine      intelligence organizations. Now it has contracts with all 16.      Its      employees fill the halls of the NSA and DHS. The corporation      was paid hundreds of millions of dollars to set up and manage      DHS's new offices in 2003, including its National Operations      Center, Office of Intelligence and Analysis and Office of      Security. Its employees do everything from deciding which      threats to investigate to answering phones.       General Dynamics' bottom line reflects its successful      transformation. It also reflects how much the U.S.      government--the firm's largest customer by far--has paid the      company beyond what it costs to do the work, which is, after      all, the goal of every profit-making corporation.       The company reported $31.9 billion in revenue in 2009, up      from $10.4 billion in 2000. Its workforce has more than      doubled in that time, from 43,300 to 91,700 employees,      according to the company.       Revenue from General Dynamics' intelligence- and      information-related divisions, where the majority of its top-     secret work is done, climbed to $10 billion in the second      quarter of 2009, up from $2.4 billion in 2000, accounting for      34 percent of its overall revenue last year.       The company's profitability is on display in its Falls      Church headquarters. There's a soaring, art-filled lobby,      bistro meals served on china enameled with the General      Dynamics logo and an auditorium with seven rows of white      leather-upholstered seats, each with its own microphone and      laptop docking station.       General Dynamics now has operations in every corner of the      intelligence world. It helps counterintelligence operators      and trains new analysts. It has a $600 million Air Force      contract to intercept communications. It makes $1 billion a      year keeping hackers out of U.S. computer networks and      encrypting military communications. It even conducts      information operations, the murky military art of trying to      persuade foreigners to align their views with U.S. interests.       ``The American intelligence community is an important      market for our company,'' said General Dynamics spokesman      Kendell Pease. ``Over time, we have tailored our organization      to deliver affordable, best-of-breed products and services to      meet those agencies' unique requirements.''       In September 2009, General Dynamics won a $10 million      contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command's      psychological operations unit to create Web sites to      influence foreigners' views of U.S. policy. To do that, the      company hired writers, editors and designers to produce a set      of daily news sites tailored to five regions of the world.      They appear as regular news Web sites, with names such as      ``SETimes.com: The News and Views of Southeast Europe.'' The      first indication that they are run on behalf of the military      comes at the bottom of the home page with the word      ``Disclaimer.'' Only by clicking on that do you learn that      ``the Southeast European Times (SET) is a Web site sponsored      by the United States European Command.''       What all of these contracts add up to: This year, General      Dynamics' overall revenue was $7.8 billion in the first      quarter, Jay L. Johnson, the company's chief executive and      president, said at an earnings conference call in April.      ``We've hit the deck running in the first quarter,'' he said,      ``and we're on our way to another successful year.''       In the shadow of giants such as General Dynamics are 1,814      small to midsize companies that do top-secret work. About a      third of them were established after Sept. 11, 2001, to take      advantage of the huge flow of taxpayer money into the private      sector. Many are led by former intelligence agency officials      who know exactly whom to approach for work.       Abraxas of Herndon, headed by a former CIA spy, quickly      became a major CIA contractor after 9/11. Its staff even      recruited midlevel managers during work hours from the CIA's      cafeteria, former agency officers recall.       Other small and medium-size firms sell niche technical      expertise such as engineering for low-orbit satellites or      long-dwell sensors. But the vast majority have not invented      anything at all. Instead, they replicate what the      government's workforce already does.       A company called SGIS, founded soon after the 2001 attacks,      was one of these.       In June 2002, from the spare bedroom of his San Diego home,      30-year-old Hany Girgis put together an information      technology team that won its first Defense Department      contract four months later. By the end of the year, SGIS had      opened a Tampa office close to the U.S. Central Command and      Special Operations Command, had turned a profit and had 30      employees.       SGIS sold the government the services of people with      specialized skills; expanding the types of teams it could put      together was one key to its growth. Eventually it offered      engineers, analysts and cyber-security specialists for      military, space and intelligence agencies. By 2003, the      company's revenue was $3.7 million. By then, SGIS had become      a subcontractor for General Dynamics, working at the secret      level. Satisfied with the partnership, General Dynamics      helped SGIS receive a top-secret facility clearance, which      opened the doors to more work.       By 2006, its revenue had multiplied tenfold, to $30.6      million, and the company had hired employees who specialized      in government contracting just to help it win more contracts.       ``We knew that's where we wanted to play,'' Girgis said in      a phone interview. ``There's always going to be a need to      protect the homeland.''       Eight years after it began, SGIS was up to revenue of $101      million, 14 offices and 675 employees. Those with top-secret      clearances worked for 11 government agencies, according to      The Post's database.       The company's marketing efforts had grown, too, both in      size and sophistication. Its Web site, for example, showed an      image of Navy sailors lined up on a battleship over the words      ``Proud to serve'' and another image of a Navy helicopter      flying near the Statue of Liberty over the words ``Preserving      freedom.'' And if it seemed hard to distinguish SGIS's work      from the government's, it's because they were doing so many      of the same things. SGIS employees replaced military      personnel at the Pentagon's 24/7 telecommunications center.      SGIS employees conducted terrorist threat analysis. SGIS      employees provided help-desk support for federal computer      systems.       Still, as alike as they seemed, there were crucial      differences.       For one, unlike in government, if an SGIS employee did a      good job, he might walk into the parking lot one day and be      surprised by co-workers clapping at his latest bonus: a      leased, dark-blue Mercedes convertible. And he might say, as      a video camera recorded him sliding into the soft leather      driver's seat, ``Ahhhh . . . this is spectacular.''       And then there was what happened to SGIS last month, when      it did the one thing the federal government can never do.       It sold itself.       The new owner is a Fairfax-based company called Salient      Federal Solutions, created just last year. It is a management      company and a private-equity firm with lots of Washington      connections that, with the purchase of SGIS, it intends to      parlay into contracts.       ``We have an objective,'' says chief executive and      President Brad Antle, ``to make $500 million in five years.''       Of all the different companies in Top Secret America, the      most numerous by far are the information technology, or IT,      firms. About 800 firms do nothing but IT.       Some IT companies integrate the mishmash of computer      systems within one agency; others build digital links between      agencies; still others have created software and hardware      that can mine and analyze vast quantities of data.       The government is nearly totally dependent on these firms.      Their close relationship was on display recently at the      Defense Intelligence Agency's annual information technology      conference in Phoenix. The agency expected the same IT firms      angling for its business to pay for the entire five-day get-     together, a DIA spokesman confirmed.       And they did.       General Dynamics spent $30,000 on the event. On a perfect      spring night, it hosted a party at Chase Field, a 48,569-seat      baseball stadium, reserved exclusively for the conference      attendees. Government buyers and corporate sellers drank beer      and ate hot dogs while the DIA director's morning keynote      speech replayed on the gigantic scoreboard, digital baseballs      bouncing along the bottom of the screen.       Carahsoft Technology, a DIA contractor, invited guests to a      casino night where intelligence officials and vendors ate,      drank and bet phony money at craps tables run by professional      dealers.       The McAfee network security company, a Defense Department      contractor, welcomed guests to a Margaritaville-themed social      on the garden terrace of the hotel across the street from the      convention site, where 250 firms paid thousands of dollars      each to advertise their services and make their pitches to      intelligence officials walking the exhibition hall.       Government officials and company executives say these      networking events are critical to building a strong      relationship between the public and private sectors.       ``If I make one contact each day, it's worth it,'' said Tom      Conway, director of federal business development for McAfee.       As for what a government agency gets out of it: ``Our goal      is to be open and learn stuff,'' said Grant M. Schneider, the      DIA's chief information officer and one of the conference's      main draws. By going outside Washington, where many of the      firms are headquartered, ``we get more synergy. . . . It's an      interchange with industry.''       These types of gatherings happen every week. Many of them      are closed to anyone without a top-secret clearance.       At a U.S. Special Operations Command conference in      Fayetteville, N.C., in April, vendors paid for access to some      of the people who decide what services and gadgets to buy for      troops. In mid-May, the national security industry held a      black-tie evening funded by the same corporations seeking      business from the defense, intelligence and congressional      leaders seated at their tables.       Such coziness worries other officials who believe the post-     9/11 defense-intelligence-corporate relationship has become,      as one senior military intelligence officer described it, a      ``self-licking ice cream cone.''       Another official, a longtime conservative staffer on the      Senate Armed Services Committee, described it as ``a living,      breathing organism'' impossible to control or curtail. ``How      much money has been involved is just mind-boggling,'' he      said. ``We've built such a vast instrument. What are you      going to do with this thing? . . . It's turned into a jobs      program.''       Even some of those gathered in Phoenix criticized the size      and disjointedness of the intelligence community and its      contracting base. ``Redundancy is the unacceptable      norm,'' Lt. Gen. Richard P. Zahner, Army deputy chief of      staff for intelligence, told the 2,000 attendees. ``Are we      spending our resources effectively? . . . If we have not      gotten our houses in order, someone will do it for us.''       On a day that also featured free back rubs, shoeshines, ice      cream and fruit smoothies, another speaker, Kevin P. Meiners,      a deputy undersecretary for intelligence, gave the audience      what he called ``the secret sauce,'' the key to thriving even      when the Defense Department budget eventually stabilizes and      stops rising so rapidly.       ``Overhead,'' Meiners told them--that's what's going to get      cut first. Overhead used to mean paper clips and toner. Now      it's information technology, IT, the very products and      services sold by the businesspeople in the audience.       ``You should describe what you do as a weapons system, not      overhead,'' Meiners instructed. ``Overhead to them--I'm      giving you the secret sauce here--is IT and people. . . . You      have to foot-stomp hard that this is a war-fighting system      that's helping save people's lives every day.''       After he finished, many of the government officials      listening headed to the exhibit hall, where company      salespeople waited in display booths. Peter Coddington, chief      executive of InTTENSITY, a small firm whose software teaches      computers to ``read'' documents, was ready for them.       ``You have to differentiate yourself,'' he said as they      fanned out into the aisles. Coddington had glass beer mugs      and pens twirling atop paperweight pyramids to help persuade      officials of the nation's largest military intelligence      agency that he had something they needed.       But first he needed them to stop walking so fast, to slow      down long enough for him to start his pitch. His twirling      pens seemed to do the job. ``It's like moths to fire,''      Coddington whispered.       A DIA official with a tote bag approached. She spotted the      pens, and her pace slowed. ``Want a pen?'' Coddington called.       She hesitated. ``Ah . . . I have three children,'' she      said.       ``Want three pens?''       She stopped. In Top Secret America, every moment is an      opportunity.       ``We're a text extraction company . . . ,'' Coddington      began, handing her the pens.",

The President indicated this program existed because we are going after the bad guys, and we have a right to do that.

But I think it is much more important the Senate pass a bill and we go to conference with the House, whichever provisions are included. I grant the provisions labor wants included are important to labor, and I grant the provisions the President wants included are important to the President. But as important as all of those provisions are, they are not as important as getting a bill that can be conferenced with the House, which can be signed by the President, so we can set up this Department of Homeland Security and we can have, under one umbrella, all of the intelligence agencies. It is not that the Secretary is going to tell the CIA agents around the globe where to go, or the FBI agents where to go, or the National Security Agency what to do, or the Defense Intelligence Agency, but as to the analysis, they should all come under one umbrella. That really is the critical factor. That is why I believe the conclusion of this bill on that issue is of greater importance than any other matter in the bill and of greater importance than any other matter which the Congress will consider during this session.

        "statement": "Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration      has repeatedly demonstrated that it does not feel bound by      the law or the Constitution when it comes to the war on      terror. It cannot even be trusted to properly use the      enhanced powers it was legally granted after the attacks.       Yet, once again, President Bush has been trying to stampede      Congress into a completely unnecessary expansion of his power      to spy on Americans. And, hard as it is to believe,      Congressional Republicans seem bent on collaborating, while      Democrats (who can still be cowed by the White House's with-     us-or-against-us baiting) aren't doing enough to stop it.       The fight is over the 1978 Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act, which requires the government to obtain a      warrant before eavesdropping on electronic communications      that involve someone in the United States. The test is      whether there is probably cause      to believe that the person being communicated with is an      agent of a foreign power or a terrorist.       Mr. Bush decided after 9/11 that he was no longer going to      obey that law. He authorized the National Security Agency to      intercept international telephone calls and e-mail messages      of Americans and other residents of this country without a      court order. He told the public nothing and Congress next to      nothing about what he was doing, until The Times disclosed      the spying in December 2005.       Ever since, the White House has tried to pressure Congress      into legalizing Mr. Bush's rogue operation. Most recently, it      seized on a secret court ruling that spotlighted a technical      way in which the 1978 law has not kept pace with the Internet      era.       The government may freely monitor communications when both      parties are outside the United States, but must get a warrant      aimed at a specific person for communications that originate      or end in his country. The Los Angeles Times reported      yesterday that the court that issues such warrants recently      ruled that the law also requires that the government seek      such an individualized warrant for purely foreign      communications that, nevertheless, move through American data      networks.       Instead of asking Congress to address this anachronism, as      it should, the White House sought to use it to destroy the      1978 spying law. It proposed giving the attorney general      carte blanche to order eavesdropping on any international      telephone calls or e-mail messages if he decided on his own      that there was a ``reasonable belief'' that the target of the      surveillance was outside the United States. The attorney      general's decision would not be subject to court approval or      any supervision.       The White House, of course, insisted that Congress must do      this right away, before the August recess that begins on      Monday--the same false urgency it used to manipulate Congress      into passing the Patriot Act without reading it and approving      the appalling Military Commissions Act of 2006.       Senator Jay Rockefeller, the chairman of the Senate      Intelligence Committee, offered a sensible alternative law,      as did his fellow Democrat, Senator Russ Feingold. In either      case, the attorney general would be able to get a broad      warrant to intercept foreign communications routed through      American networks for a limited period. Then, he would have      to justify the spying in court. This fix would have an      expiration date so Congress could then dispassionately      consider what permanent changes might be needed to FISA.       Congress was debating this issue yesterday, and the final      outcome was unclear. But there are very clear lines that must      not be crossed.       First, all electronic surveillance of communication that      originates or ends in the United States must be subject to      approval and review by the FISA court under the 1978 law.      (That court, by the way, has rejected only one warrant in the      last two years.)       Second, any measure Congress approves now must have a firm      expiration date. Closed-door-meetings under the pressure of a      looming vacation are no place for such serious business.       The administration and its Republican supporters in      Congress argue that American intelligence is blinded by FISA      and have seized on neatly timed warnings of heightened      terrorist activity to scare everyone. It is vital for      Americans, especially law-makers, to resist that argument. It      is pure propaganda.       This is not, and has never been, a debate over whether the      United States should conduct effective surveillance of      terrorists and their supporters. It is over whether we are a      nation ruled by law, or the whims of men in power. Mr. Bush      faced that choice and made the wrong one. Congress must not      follow him off the cliff.",

The NID will develop and present the President with an annual budget request for these and other intelligence programs. It is unclear whether the Secretary of Defense or the NID will control the actual payroll. Under Collins-Lieberman, ``tactical'' military intelligence and the Defense Intelligence Agency will remain under the DOD. But the bill does not define ``tactical.'' Obviously, DOD will seek to define that term broadly, and the NID will seek to define it narrowly. I understand Senator Feinstein may offer an amendment that would define ``tactical'' and provide some clarity, but even if that amendment is enacted, the battle will be waged over how to interpret the Feinstein definition of ``tactical.'' My friends Senators Specter, Roberts, Shelby, DeWine, Bond, Wyden, Bayh and others already think the NID should have even more control over agencies currently within the DOD than the Collins-Lieberman bill would allow, but their amendment failed.",

Such assessment shall--       (1) identify vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the      electronics and information processing systems of the      selected programs, including microcircuits, software, and      firmware;       (2) prioritize the potential vulnerabilities and effects of      the various elements and stages of the system supply chain to      identify the most effective balance of investments to      minimize the effects of compromise;       (3) provide recommendations regarding ways of managing      supply chain risk for covered acquisition programs; and       (4) identify the appropriate lead person, and supporting      elements, within the Department of Defense for the      development of an integrated strategy for managing risk in      the supply chain for covered acquisition programs.       (b) Assessment of Methods for Verifying the Trust of      Semiconductors Procured From Commercial Sources.--The Under      Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and      Logistics, in consultation with appropriate elements of the      Department of Defense, the intelligence community, private      industry, and academia, shall conduct an assessment of      various methods of verifying the trust of semiconductors      procured by the Department of Defense from commercial sources      for use in mission-critical components of potentially      vulnerable defense systems. The assessment shall include the      following:       (1) An identification of various methods of verifying the      trust of semiconductors, including methods under development      at the Defense Agencies, government laboratories,      institutions of higher education, and in the private sector.       (2) A determination of the methods identified under      paragraph (1) that are most suitable for the Department of      Defense.       (3) An assessment of the additional research and technology      development needed to develop methods of verifying the trust      of semiconductors that meet the needs of the Department of      Defense.       (4) Any other matters that the Under Secretary considers      appropriate.       (c) Strategy Required.--       (1) In general.--The lead person identified under      subsection (a)(4), in cooperation with the supporting      elements also identified under such subsection, shall develop      an integrated strategy--       (A) for managing risk--       (i) in the supply chain of electronics and information      processing systems for covered acquisition programs; and       (ii) in the procurement of semiconductors; and       (B) that ensures dependable, continuous, long-term access      and trust for all mission-critical semiconductors procured      from both foreign and domestic sources.       (2) Requirements.--At a minimum, the strategy shall--       (A) address the vulnerabilities identified by the      assessment under subsection (a);       (B) reflect the priorities identified by such assessment;       (C) provide guidance for the planning, programming,      budgeting, and execution process in order to ensure that      covered acquisition programs have the necessary resources to      implement all appropriate elements of the strategy;       (D) promote the use of verification tools, as appropriate,      for ensuring trust of commercially acquired systems;       (E) increase use of trusted foundry services, as      appropriate; and       (F) ensure sufficient oversight in implementation of the      plan.       (d) Policies and Actions for Assuring Trust in Integrated      Circuits.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall--       (1) develop policy requiring that trust assurance be a high      priority for covered acquisition programs in all phases of      the electronic component supply chain and integrated circuit      development and production process, including design and      design tools, fabrication of the semiconductors, packaging,      final assembly, and test;       (2) develop policy requiring that programs whose      electronics and information systems are determined to be      vital to operational readiness or mission effectiveness are      to employ trusted foundry services to fabricate their custom      designed integrated circuits, unless the Secretary      specifically authorizes otherwise;       (3) incorporate the strategies and policies of the      Department of Defense regarding development and use of      trusted integrated circuits into all relevant Department      directives and instructions related to the acquisition of      integrated circuits and programs that use such circuits; and       (4) take actions to promote the use and development of      tools that verify the trust in all phases of the integrated      circuit development and production process of mission-     critical parts acquired from non-trusted sources.       (e) Submission to Congress.--Not later than 12 months after      the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of      Defense shall submit to the congressional defense      committees--       (1) the assessments required by subsections (a) and (b);       (2) the strategy required by subsection (c); and       (3) a description of the policies developed and actions      taken under subsection (d).       (f) Definitions.--In this section:       (1) The term ``covered acquisition programs'' means an      acquisition program of the Department of Defense that is a      major system for purposes of section 2302(5) of title 10,      United States Code.       (2) The terms ``trust'' and ``trusted'' refer, with respect      to electronic and information processing systems, to the      ability of the Department of Defense to have confidence that      the systems function as intended and are free of exploitable      vulnerabilities, either intentionally or unintentionally      designed or inserted as part of the system at any time during      its life cycle.       (3) The term ``trusted foundry services'' means the program      of the National Security Agency and the Department of      Defense, or any similar program approved by the Secretary of      Defense, for the development and manufacture of integrated      circuits for critical defense systems in secure industrial      environments.",

That system is now on watch across the country to provide early warnings against new epidemics created by nature or by terrorist activity. Dr. Roca was also one of the first to recognize the threat from cyber attacks and call for comprehensive cyber defenses. It was under his leadership that APL established major partnerships with the National Security Agency to develop and test new cybersecurity tools.

        "statement": "What's this about governments spying on their closest      allies?       We called it ``the bubble.'' It was a 12-by-15-foot      acoustic conference room made of clear plastic and aluminum.      There were at least five inches of space between the walls of      the bubble and the walls of the room in which it was located.      The bubble's plastic walls, ceiling and floor allowed visual      inspection for electronic listening devices, or ``bugs.''       As an extra security measure, a noise-generating machine      was installed in the outer room to prevent interception of      any discussions of classified information within the bubble.      The outer room was secured by a combination lock, the code      known only to my office.       The first U.S. ``bubble'' was installed after hidden      microphones were found in American diplomatic missions in      Moscow, Prague and elsewhere in the 1960s.       Our bubble, within a room on an upper floor of the U. S.      Embassy in Bad Godesberg, West Germany, was a countermeasure      against possible technical penetration by the Soviet KGB and      the East German Stasi. But Eastern Bloc countries weren't the      only concern.       Our bubble allowed classified discussions to occur beyond      the hearing of our host and ally, the-then Federal Republic      of Germany, and our friends down the road in the French and      British embassies.       That was nearly 50 years ago.       This year, in my current capacity, I was sitting in the      office of an ambassador in Washington when a member of his      staff alerted him to an important call. There was a phone on      the ambassador's desk. But he left the room to take the call.       It turns out that his prime minister was calling from      overseas. The ambassador went to a secure location in the      embassy where he could conduct a confidential conversation.       True, he was in the capital city of his nation's closest      ally. But the matter to be discussed was for the ears of his      countrymen only, U. S. friendship notwithstanding.       Today, as the United States has been doing for decades,      close allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere take      similar precautions even when their missions are in friendly      countries.       Gentlemen may know that it is bad form to read each other's      mail or to eavesdrop. But in diplomacy and national security,      the desire to know what another country is up to tends to      overwhelm any sense of rectitude.       Consequently, the European outrage over snooping among      friends may be slightly overdone. That is an entirely      separate matter from the National Security Agency's (NSA)      vacuum-cleanerlike collection of the communication records      and metadata of millions of Americans, including private      citizens and, apparently, foreign citizens both here and      overseas. The scope of that intelligence-collection program,      disputed by Gen. Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA,      this week is the cause of uproar around the country and in      Congress. There is still much to sort out and probably      reform.       The monitoring of foreign leaders' phone calls, however, is      closer to the larger deed of spying on allied governments.       Which takes us to an indelicate question: Why is a foreign      leader, a repository of a nation's secrets, communicating by      text messages and smartphone?       The most junior Foreign Service officer or government civil      servant entrusted with sensitive information assumes that e-     mails and cellphones are susceptible to eavesdropping. What      makes a head of state behave as if he or she is immune from      monitoring?       Which brings up another tactless question: Why haven't the      security services of those foreign leaders developed      countermeasures to prevent successful spying on personal      communications?       The danger here isn't simply that the NSA may have      overstepped its bounds with respect to U.S. allies. The      intelligence services of the foes of Germany, France, Spain,      Brazil and the like may have the capacity to listen in on      high-level conversations.       The naivete of outraged foreign leaders and their      vulnerability to spying are nearly--but not totally--as      surprising as the scale of NSA snooping.       The NSA revelations, meanwhile, should not draw attention      away from the revelations' primary source: Edward Joseph      Snowden.       How in the world is it possible that a high school dropout      with a GED, a community college student who didn't graduate,      a failed Army recruit and security guard can catapult himself      into a CIA information technology job, an overseas posting      and subsequently a $200,000-a-year job with a company      contracted to do NSA work in Hawaii, where he was able to      gain access to the crown jewels of America's secrets?       Whistleblower, traitor, patriot: Debate the labels all you      want. The government has charged him with espionage. Take it      up with Attorney General Eric Holder.       I want to know how Snowden got his hands on so much of the      nation's most sensitive intelligence and was able to flee the      country, all within three months.       Damage? Done by the U.S. government to itself.",

Agencies throughout government use advisory committees that function under open meetings rules and the open meetings law is careful to protect discussions and documents that involve sensitive information. The law currently applies to the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the State Department, the National Security Agency, and others. In my view, the administration has failed to make the case for exempting the Homeland Security Department from the requirement that records for committee meetings should make available to the public.",

In fact, in January of 2000, the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee, an entity within the National Security Agency, proposed a policy that called on all Government agencies to purchase only those commercial-off-the-shelf, or COTS, software that had undergone an independent evaluation process that tests the security of the software. Toward that goal, the committee outlined a specific acquisition policy for those information systems critical to national security. This policy--the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Policy #11, or NSTISSP #11--states that Federal agencies with information systems involved in national security can only purchase commercial information assurance software that has been independently evaluated to be secure.",

        "statement": "Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,      President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to      target al Qaeda communications into and out of the country.      Mr. Bush concluded that this was essential for protecting the      country, that using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act      would not permit the necessary speed and agility, and that he      had the constitutional power to authorize such surveillance      without court orders to defend the country.       Since the program became public in 2006, Congress has been      asserting appropriate oversight. Few of those who learned the      details of the program have criticized its necessity.      Instead, critics argued that if the president found FISA      inadequate, he should have gone to Congress and gotten the      changes necessary to allow the program to proceed under court      orders. That process is now underway. The administration has      brought the program under FISA, and the Senate Intelligence      Committee recently reported out a bill with a strong      bipartisan majority of 13-2, that would make the changes to      FISA needed for the program to continue. This bill is now      being considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.       Public disclosure of the NSA program also brought a flood      of class-action lawsuits seeking to impose massive liability      on phone companies for allegedly answering the government's      call for help. The Intelligence Committee has reviewed the      program and has concluded that the companies deserve targeted      protection from these suits. The protection would extend only      to activities undertaken after 9/11 until the beginning of      2007, authorized by the president to defend the country from      further terrorist attack, and pursuant to written assurances      from the government that the activities were both authorized      by the president and legal.       We agree with the committee. Dragging phone companies      through protracted litigation would not only be unfair, but      it would deter other companies and private citizens from      responding in terrorist emergencies whenever there may be      uncertainty or legal risk.       The government alone cannot protect us from the threats we      face today. We must have the help of all our citizens. There      will be times when the lives of thousands of Americans will      depend on whether corporations such as airlines or banks are      willing to lend assistance. If we do not treat companies      fairly when they respond to assurances from the highest      levels of the government that their help is legal and      essential for saving lives, then we will be radically      reducing our society's capacity to defend itself.       This concern is particularly acute for our nation's      telecommunications companies. America's front line of defense      against terrorist attack is communications intelligence. When      Americans put their loved ones on planes, send their children      to school, or ride through tunnels and over bridges, they are      counting on the ``early warning'' system of communications      intelligence for their safety. Communications technology has      become so complex that our country needs the voluntary      cooperation of the companies. Without it, our intelligence      efforts will be gravely damaged.       Whether the government has acted properly is a different      question from whether a private person has acted properly in      responding to the government's call for help. From its      earliest days, the common law recognized that when a public      official calls on a citizen to help protect the community in      an emergency, the person has a duty to help and should be      immune from being hauled into court unless it was clear      beyond doubt that the public official was acting illegally.      Because a private person cannot have all the information      necessary to assess the propriety of the government's      actions, he must be able to rely on official assurances about      need and legality. Immunity is designed to avoid the burden      of protracted litigation, because the prospect of such      litigation itself is enough to deter citizens from providing      critically needed assistance.       As the Intelligence Committee found, the companies clearly      acted in ``good faith.'' The situation is one in which      immunity has traditionally been applied, and thus protection      from this litigation is justified.       First, the circumstances clearly showed that there was a      bona fide threat to ``national security.'' We had suffered      the most devastating attacks in our history, and Congress had      declared the attacks ``continue to pose an unusual and      extraordinary threat'' to the country. It would have been      entirely reasonable for the companies to credit government      representations that the nation faced grave and immediate      threat and that their help was needed to protect American      lives.       Second, the bill's protections only apply if assistance was      given in response to the president's personal authorization,      communicated in writing along with assurances of legality.      That is more than is required by FISA, which contains a safe-     harbor authorizing assistance based solely on a certification      by the attorney general, his designee, or a host of more      junior law enforcement officials that no warrant is required.       Third, the ultimate legal issue--whether the president was      acting within his constitutional powers--is not the kind of      question a private party can definitively determine. The      companies were not in a position to say that the government      was definitely wrong.       Prior to FISA's 1978 enactment, numerous federal courts      took it for granted that the president has constitutional      power to conduct warrantless surveillance to protect the      nation's security. In 2002, the FISA Court of Review, while      not dealing directly with the NSA program, stated that FISA      could not limit the president's constitutional powers. Given      this, it cannot be said that the companies acted in bad faith      in relying on the government's assurances of legality.       For hundreds of years our legal system has operated under      the premise that, in a public emergency, we want private      citizens to respond to the government's call for help unless      the citizen knows for sure that the government is acting      illegally. If Congress does not act now, it would be      basically saying that private citizens should only help when      they are absolutely certain that all the government's actions      are legal. Given the threats we face in today's world, this      would be a perilous policy.",

        "statement": "Verizon's willingness to turn over customer telephone      records when the government asks--even though investigators      often make such requests without a court order--is a      troubling practice.       The company may be motivated by a desire to help--or to      avoid government confrontation. But Verizon's approach,      disclosed in a letter to Congress this week, is the wrong way      to go about this.       The burden of proof rests with the federal government to      prove its need for the records. Except in rare instances,      investigators must take their records requests to a judge who      then can determine whether to issue a warrant. The      Constitution intends just that, in language that fairly      balances privacy fears and law enforcement.       Yet the Bush administration insists on continuing to push      the post-9/11 civil liberties vs. security debate in the      wrong direction. Because telecom companies that have complied      with its requests now face huge lawsuits from citizens-rights      groups, the administration wants a law to grant immune      businesses sued for disclosing information without court      authorization.       Congress is right to look at the immunity proposal with a      skeptical eye, especially since the administration has been      reluctant to explain details of its controversial      surveillance program to lawmakers. The law would further      erode the privacy firewall and remove another layer of checks      and balances.       The phone companies, meanwhile, have refused to tell      relevant congressional committees whether they participated      in the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping      program. Their silence is based on concerns that they might      illegally divulge classified information if they talk to      Congress in too much detail.       Yet Congress and the courts have legitimate oversight roles      in issues of privacy and national security. Due process is      necessary to promote transparency and accountability in a      democracy. These are foundational principles, even in the      more dangerous post-9/11 world.",

What appears to have happened is a major change in how electronic surveillance is conducted in this country. Surveillance used to be particularized--investigators would pick a target and then intercept the communications of that target. But now, it appears the Administration is using advances in technology to move to a wholesale surveillance regime, where everything is intercepted and then investigators sift through the hay to pick their targets. In other words, the Administration is seizing millions of Americans' communications--billions of phone calls and e-mails and more--in a 21st century high-tech equivalent of the King's general warrants that our Founders fought a revolution to avoid.",

        "statement": "Firing Porter Goss was the easy part. The challenge now is      to complete the reorganization of U.S. intelligence so that      the 16 spy agencies under Director of National Intelligence      John Negroponte are fighting America's enemies rather than      battling each other in bureaucratic turf wars.       But how to fit the pieces together? That's the quandary for      Negroponte and Gen. Michael Hayden, the administration's      nominee to succeed the miscast Goss. I suggest they take a      careful look at the British model. The Brits have a basic      division of labor: a small, elite Secret Intelligence Service      (known as MI6) collects human intelligence; an interagency      group known as the Joint Intelligence Committee analyzes that      information for policymakers and tells the spies what to      collect. When I look at Negroponte's organization chart,      that's the model that I hope is emerging. If so, he's moving      in the right direction.       At the core of the intelligence puzzle is the CIA, whose      very name is outdated. It is no longer the Central      Intelligence Agency, coordinating the work of the community.      That's the DNI's job now. In a sensible reorganization, the      CIA should refocus on the specific mission for which it was      created more than 50 years ago--gathering HUMINT, which is      intelligence jargon for the secrets between someone's ears.      The days when the CIA could be all things to all intelligence      consumers are over. Today's CIA should be a truly secret      intelligence service in which the job of analysts is to      target operations. The all-source analysis that creates      finished intelligence should be managed by the DNI.       Making this transition at the CIA will be painful, and      Hayden is a good choice for the necessary surgery. As a      feisty military officer, he's paradoxically the right person      to fend off poaching by the Pentagon. By his own admission,      Hayden doesn't know much about the CIA's operational work,      but he does know how to modernize a big, hidebound      bureaucracy. He did that at the National Security Agency--     helping the wiretappers adapt to a new world of e-mail,      fiber-optic cables and wireless phones. He made enemies at      the NSA, but he was a successful change agent.       Hayden will have the ideal partner in Stephen Kappes, who      is slated to be deputy director. Kappes is something of a      legend at the agency: a charismatic ex-Marine who knows how      to lead from the front. He punched all the tickets--fixing a      broken Iranian operations group that had lost a string of      agents, serving as chief of station in Moscow and as head      of counterintelligence, and visiting Moammar Gaddafi and      persuading him to give up his nuclear weapons program.      Kappes's pitch to the Libyan leader is said to have been      blunt, and irresistible: You are the drowning man and I am      the lifeguard.       Kappes is the CIA version of the ultimate stand-up guy.      After achieving his dream of heading the Directorate of      Operations, Kappes walked away from the job in late 2004      rather than fire his deputy, Mike Sulick, as demanded by one      of the conservative hatchet men Goss had brought with him      from Capitol Hill. A former agency officer remembers the      reaction to Kappes's departure: ``It was a devastating body      blow, like someone has punched you in the solar plexus. The      wind came out of the sails that day and it has never come      back.''       Kappes had a plan for reorganizing the Directorate of      Operations when he left, and he's in a position to implement      it now. It's said that he wants to create a far more nimble      spy service--one that can attack terrorist groups and other      targets around the world more aggressively. Today the CIA is      still locked in a Cold War structure, with the same fixed      array of directorates and geographical divisions. The agency      is frantically hiring new case officers, but under the old      structure there aren't ``OCPs'' (or overseas covered      positions) ready for them, so many of the young recruits      languish, ``stacked up at headquarters like cordwood'' in the      phrase of one CIA insider.       CIA veterans say Kappes hopes to create an operations      capability that's more like a flying squad--detached from      headquarters and its layers of bureaucracy. If an al-Qaeda      call surfaces on a remote island in the Philippines where the      United States doesn't have an embassy or consulate, officers      from Kappes's revamped spy service could grab a laptop and be      on their way in hours.       Maybe it's time to say goodbye to those three spooky      initials ``CIA'' and the bloated, barnacle-encrusted agency      they represent. Let Negroponte move his shop to Langley and      create a new elite analytical service there. Meanwhile, let      the covert operatives slip away in the night to destinations      unknown, where they can get to work stealing the secrets that      will keep America safe.",

        "statement": "In his testimony, Secretary Rumsfeld discussed in detail      his concerns about how intelligence community reorganization      could potentially adversely affect the Defense Department. He      expressed his strong reservations about the national      collection agencies--the NSA, NGA, and NRO--being removed      from the Defense Department (where they are now located) and      aligned under the direct leadership of the National      Intelligence Director. He stated:       ``We wouldn't want to place new barriers or filters between      the military Combatant Commanders and those agencies when      they perform as combat support agencies. It would be a major      step to separate these key agencies from the military      Combatant Commanders, which are the major users of such      capabilities.''       The Defense Department worked tirelessly in the decade      after the first Gulf War to ensure that the speed and scope      of intelligence support to military operations would be      improved for future conflicts. It was General Schwartzkopf's      view that the national intelligence support during Desert      Storm was not adequate. Now, as we've seen from the success      of our military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the      broader War on Terror, ``gaps and seams,'' as Secretary      Rumsfeld refers to them, have been drastically reduced.       General Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also      expressed his concerns on the subject during his testimony to      the Senate Armed Services Committee, stating:       ``. . . for the warfighter, from the combatant commander      down to the private on patrol, timely, accurate intelligence      is literally a life and death matter every day. . . . As we      move forward, we cannot create any institutional barriers      between intelligence agencies--and of course that would      include the National Security Agency, the National      Geospacial-Intelligence Agency, and the National      Reconnaissance office and the rest of the warfighting team.''       I am concerned that the reorganization package before the      Senate places this effective system in jeopardy.       In S. 2485, the NSA, NGA, and NRO remain within DOD; but      this is somewhat deceiving. These national collection      agencies will also be within the newly defined ``National      Intelligence Program.'' The Committee-reported bill would      essentially remove the Secretary of Defense from any      meaningful management role over these agencies.       First, the National Intelligence Director would have the      authority to appoint the heads of these agencies, albeit with      the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense. What makes this      unusual and potentially problematic? Well, consider the fact      that the Director of the National Security Agency, a General      Officer, is dual-hatted as the Deputy Commander for Network      Attack, Planning, and Integration at Strategic Command, or      that the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office also      serves as an Under Secretary of the Air Force. These      positions truly support the mission of the Defense      Department.       Second, the National Intelligence Director would have the      authority to execute the budgets of these agencies. It is one      thing to say that the NID should manage the entire budget for      the National Intelligence Program, and, therefore, to help      develop agencies' budgets and even receive their      appropriation. It is quite another to altogether remove the      Secretary of Defense from the loop by requiring that the NID      suballocate funding directly back to the agencies. This      effectively removes the Secretary from the management loop.       I have studied the Defense Secretary's testimony to the      Senate Armed Services Committee, as well as the testimony of      other experts. I am also aware that there were some good      amendments in the Committee mark-up to help preserve the      Defense Department's equities. But I am still not convinced      that we are doing no harm. As General Myers commented during      the course of the Senate Armed Services Committee's      discussion on the subject, ``[T]he devil's in the details.''",

        "statement": "The OPM hack is just the latest in a series of Federal      network intrusions and data breaches, including recent      incidents at the Internal Revenue Service, the State      Department, and even the White House. These attacks have      occurred despite the $4.5 billion National Cybersecurity and      Protection System program and its centerpiece capability,      Einstein. Falling under the Department of Homeland Security's      watch, that system sits astride the government's trusted      Internet gateways. Einstein was originally based on deep      packet inspection technology first deployed over a decade      ago, and the system's latest $218 million upgrade was      supposed to make it capable of more active attack prevention.      But the track flow analysis and signature detection      capabilities of Einstein, drawn from both DHS traffic      analysis and data shared by the National Security Agency,      appears to be incapable of catching the sort of tactics that      have become the modern baseline for state-sponsored network      espionage and criminal attacks. Once such attacks are      executed, they tend to look like normal network traffic.       Put simply, as new capabilities for Einstein are being      rolled out, they're not keeping pace with the types of      threats now facing federal agencies. And with the data from      OPM and other breaches, foreign intelligence services have a      goldmine of information about federal employees at every      level of the government.",

        "statement": "The call came after dinner on a Monday night, as the      general was watching the TV news at home. There was a      computer problem back at the agency. A software failure had      knocked out the network.       ``Give me a sense,'' the general commanded the duty officer      over the secure phone line. ``What are we talking about?''       ``The whole system is down,'' the duty officer said. A      result of overloading. Plus, the network had become so      tangled that no one really seemed to know how it worked.      There was no wiring diagram anyone could consult. It was      January 24, 2000. Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden was still new on      the job--just finishing his 10th month as director of the      National Security Agency--but he did not need a duty officer      to explain the implications of his computer problem. The      agency's constellation of spy satellites and its giant      listening stations on five continents were still vacuuming      communications out of the either. Their vast electronic      ``take''--intercepted telephone calls, e-mails, faxes and      radio signals--still poured into memory buffers capable of      storing 5 trillion pages of data at agency headquarters at      Fort Meade. But once in house, the data froze. Nobody could      access it, nobody could analyze it.       The NSA--the largest and most powerful spy agency in the      world--was brain-dead.       Hayden called George J. Tenet on a secure phone and broke      the news to the director of central intelligence. The      nation's two top spymasters knew there was nothing they could      do but get out of the way and let the technicians try to      figure out what was wrong. The keepers of the nation's      secrets now had another one to keep--a secret Saddam Hussein      or Osama bin Laden or some other enemy of the state could      have surely used to great advantage.       The next morning, the only consolation Hayden had was the      snow: A blizzard had blasted Washington and shut down the      federal government, giving his gathering army of computer      engineers and techies some time--without the workforce      around--to bring the agency out of its coma. Hayden's despair      deepened as two full days passed without progress. The      mathematicians and linguists reported back for duty Thursday      morning, only to find a handwritten message taped to doors      and computer terminals: ``Our network is experiencing      intermittent difficulties. Consult your supervisor before you      log on.''       The crash had now become a security crisis. By noon, at a      hastily called ``town meeting,'' Hayden walked onto the stage      of the agency's Friedman Auditorium and told thousands of      employees--in person and on closed-circuit television--what      had happened.       ``We are the keeper of the nation's secrets,'' he said at      the end of his grim presentation. ``If word of this gets out,      we significantly increase the likelihood that Americans will      get hurt. Those who would intend our nation and our citizens      harm will be emboldened. So this is not the back half of a      sentence tonight that begins, `Honey, you won't believe what      happened to me at work.' This is secret. It does not leave      the building.''       Could all 30,000 employees live by the code of secrecy      they'd grown up with?       To Hayden, a career intelligence officer who had served in      the first Bush White House and had run the Air Force's      cyberwar center, the computer crash seemed the perfect      matephor for an agency desperately in need of new technology.      But the reality, he would quickly see, was actually worse.      Antiquated computers were the least of the NSA's problems.       By virtue of its magnitude and complexity, the NSA invites      superlatives and outsize comparisons. Its collections systems      scoop up enough data every three hours to fill the Library of      Congress. It employs the world's largest collection of      linguists and mathematicians and owns the world's largest      array of supercomputers. To power the supercomputers, it uses      as much electricity as the city of Annapolis. To cool them,      it maintains 8,000 tons of chilled water capacity. One of its      most powerful computers generates so much heat it operates      while immersed in a nonconducting liquid called Flourinert.       But beyond the gee-whiz factor lies an agency in need of      reinvention.       Heir to America's World War II code-breaking heroics, the      agency was created in secret by President Harry Truman in      1952. Signals intelligence--SIGINT, in spy parlance--has long      been considered even more valuable than human intelligence or      satellite imagery, because the quantity and quality of the      potential take is so much greater. The NSA was intended to be      the world's premier SIGINT agency, encoding American secret      communications while stealing and decoding other nations'.      Soon after its founding, the agency started growing into a      juggernaut that would put listening posts around the globe,      spy ships and submarines out to sea, and reconnaissance      planes and satellites in the heavens.       The NSA rose to dominance in what were, in      telecommunications terms, simpler times. Radio signals and      microwaves were ripe for the taking as they bounced off the      ionosphere or traveled straight out into space; to intercept      them, one simply needed to get in their path. And the NSA      did this better than anyone else, using everything from      portable receivers that picked up vibrations off      windowpanes to geosynchronous satellites 22,000 miles      above Earth.       It was the NSA that first reported the presence of Soviet      offensive missiles in Cuba in 1962. It was the NSA that first      warned of the Tet offensive--five days before the attacks      commenced across South Vietnam in January 1968. All told, the      NSA broke the codes of 40 nations during the Cold War and,      through an operation code-named Gamma Guppy, intercepted      personal conversations of Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev. In      1986, President Ronald Reagan went so far as to bomb Col.      Moammar Gaddafi's Tripoli headquarters      after NSA intercepts revealed Libya's role in a terrorist      attack on a Berlin discotheque that had killed two U.S.      servicemen and a Turkish woman.       Making and breaking codes requires absolute secrecy, and      the NSA took secrecy to extremes. Most Americans had never      even heard of the agency for decades after it was      established. In 1975, a Senate select committee headed by      Sen. Frank Church revealed that the NSA had far exceeded the      foreign intelligence mission envisioned by Truman and had      been spying domestically on the likes of Jane Fonda, Joan      Baez, Benjamin Spock and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.       The revelations led to laws and regulations that strictly      prohibit the NSA from spying on U.S. soil--laws and      regulations, agency officials say, they now strictly follow.      But the agency's cult of secrecy proved far more resilient.      Even after the Church committee's revelations, it was a      standing joke at Fort Meade that NSA stood for No Such Agency      or Never Say Anything. In 1982, when author James Bamford was      writing his groundbreaking first book about the agency, The      Puzzle Palace, the Reagan administration threatened to      prosecute him for espionage if he did not return sensitive      documents he had obtained through the Freedom of Information      Act. The administration ultimately backed down, but its      treatment of Bamford was a sign of how secretive and arrogant      the NSA had become. (By contrast, Hayden cooperated with      Bamford on his second book about the NSA, Body of Secrets,      which was published in May.)       The agency's high opinion of itself was backed up by its      success throughout the Cold War, success that rested on three      pillars: massive budgets, superior technology and the luxury      of having a single main adversary--the Soviet Union--that      enjoyed neither of those first two advantages.       Now, all those pillars have crumbled.       The NSA is still one of the largest employers in the state      of Maryland, but it lost 30 percent of its budget and an      equivalent slice of its workforce during the 1990s. And      instead of one backward adversary, the agency found itself      trying to deploy against elusive terrorist groups, drug      cartels and rogue states, in addition to a full slate of      traditional targets ranging from Russia to China to India to      Pakistan. In 1980, the NSA focused about 60 percent of its      budget on the Soviet Union. By 1993, less than 15 percent was      fixed on Russia.       But if the end of the Cold War was hard on the NSA, the      onset of the digital age was harder. More and more      communications were moving through hard-to-tap fiber-optic      cable. More and more were encoded with powerful new      encryption software that was proving virtually impossible to      break. By the late 1990s, NSA officials had given up a futile      effort to limit the spread of encryption software, but they      were left fearful of how their agency's capabilities could      wither if, say, Microsoft started building powerful      encryption algorithms into its operating systems.       More immediately, the NSA had to confront the exploding      volume of global communications. In the 1950s, there were      5,000 computers in the world and not a single fax machine or      cell phone. Today, there are more than 100 million hosts on      the Internet serving hundreds of millions of networked      computers, not to mention 650 million cell phones in use      worldwide. And with broadband fiber-optic cable being laid      around the world at the rate of hundreds of miles an hour      (virtually the speed of sound), the speed for moving digital      data down these slender pipes more than doubles annually--     faster even than computing power, which doubles every year      and a half.       With more and more digital data moving across the Internet      and bouncing off communications satellites, SIGINT has become      more important than ever. Yet the interceptible data stream      has threatened to drown the NSA's analysts in a roiling sea      of 1s and 0s.       In this new context, private industry suddenly controls the      technology that the NSA needs to keep pace. But the NSA has      been isolated from the dynamism of the market by its own cult      of secrecy. The agency has fallen farther and farther behind,      unable to sort through a torrent of information streaming      back into Fort Meade's computers and, to some extent,      incapable of replacing its Cold War troops trained in radio      intercepts and Russian with Internet engineers and Arabic      speakers.       In 1999, the House Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence declared that the NSA was ``in serious      trouble,'' desperately short of capital and leadership. Civil      libertarians, Internet privacy activities and encryption      entrepreneurs--not to mention the European Parliament and      thousands, perhaps millions, of ordinary Europeans--question      the continuing need for such an agency, describing the NSA as      an ``extreme threat to the privacy of people all over the      world,'' in the words of an American Civil Liberties Union      Web site.       But the U.S. government considers SIGINT so essential that      one senior intelligence official recently called the NSA's      possible demise the greatest single threat to U.S. national      security. So, three years ago, when the House and Senate      intelligence committees began sounding the alarm, the      director of central intelligence began an all-out search for      somebody to fill the NSA's leadership void. George Tenet      turned to a man who lacked the innate spookiness normally      associated with this spookiest of agencies. A small man with      a crew cut and a bald pate. A man with a scholarly interest      in history. A man who would show no fear of either the public      or the agency he would have to overhaul.       Michael Hayden, 56, grew up in an era when the backbone of      America's industrial might comprised steel mills and      factories, in a neighborhood on Pittsburgh's North Side where      men carried lunch buckets to work and proudly traced their      ancestors to County Galway.       His father, Harry Hayden Sr., was a welder at Allis-     Chalmers, a plant that made giant electrical transformers.      Harry worked the 3:30-to-midnight shift, leaving his wife,      Sadie, to raise their three children almost by herself. But      he remembers how, when he would awake before dawn and walk to      the bathroom, the light would always be on in Michael's room      at 5:30 in the morning. The boy was studying.       Michael was a standout student, and an athlete as well.      ``We never had to talk about Michael,'' says Harry, now 81.      ``Everybody else was.''       As early as grade school, Michael showed a talent for      impressing talent spotters. His football coach at the St.      Peter's parochial schools says Hayden clearly had ``the      smarts'' to play quarterback--no small judgment, coming as it      does from Dan Rooney, son of the founding owner of the      Pittsburgh Steelers and now the franchise's president. In      time, however, Hayden distinguished himself most in the      classroom, graduating near the top of his class at North      Catholic High School and at Duquesne University, where he      majored in history.       One day, he surprised his father by coming home from      college and announcing that he had signed up for Air Force      ROTC. It was 1967, when a lot of young men were burning their      draft cards to protest the Vietnam War. ``He wanted to      travel, and I guess there wasn't a better way to do it,''      Harry says. Still, after graduating, Michael married his      college sweetheart, a Chicagoan named Jeanine Carrier. She      typed and proofread his master's thesis in American history      at Duquesne while he drove a cab, worked as a nigh bellman at      the Dusquesne Club and coached St. Peter's to a football      title.       Then he started his service in the Air Force, as an analyst      and briefer at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command      at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Harry Hayden Jr.      figures his older brother joined the service because he had      read everything he could about American history and wanted to      start participating.       A decade into his Air Force career, Michael held the rank      of major and was chief of intelligence for a fighter wing at      Osan Air Base in South Korea. The director of operations,      Col. Chuck Link, a fighter pilot, detected the same      leadership qualities Dan Rooney had recognized years earlier.      So did Hayden's men. Gene Tighe, a young intelligence      officer, remembers Hayden more as a mentor than a commanding      officer. ``He thought it was a great thing to be out and      about and getting this opportunity overseas,'' Tighe recalls.      ``He wanted us to see the temples, the rice paddies, go      shopping in Hong Kong. He took a vested interest in making      you feel important.''       After Osan, Hayden spent six months studying at the Armed      Forces Staff College in Norfolk and 18 months learning      Bulgarian before he became an Air Force attache to Sofia.       Two years later, he came home without a new assignment, but      Link quickly recruited him to a job on a prestigious policy      and planning staff inside Air Force headquarters at the      Pentagon. Soon Link's boss, Gen. Chuck Boyd, the Air Force's      director of plans, took notice of Hayden's ability to think      conceptually and put his thoughts down on paper.       ``He's got the soul of a historian, he really does,'' Boyd      says. ``He thinks things are explainable on the basis of how      things have been. It's a scholarly bent, combined with an      exceptional sensitivity to human behavior.''       One day in the summer of 1989, Boyd told Hayden to go down      to the National Security Council and see two men, an Air      Force general and an arms-control expert. Hayden took the      Metro across the river and reported to an office on the third      floor of the Old Executive Office Building. Only then did he      realize the he'd been sent to a job interview.       He spent the next two years as the NSC's director for      defense policy and arms control, where he wrote national      security adviser Brent Scowcroft's annual policy document on      strategy, then two more years at the Pentagon running a      policy staff for the secretary of the Air Force. In 1993,      Boyd, then commander of the U.S. European Command in      Stuttgart, Germany, asked Hayden to head its intelligence      directorate as the United States was becoming directly      involved in the Balkans. From his attache days in Bulgaria,      Hayden probably knew the region as well as anyone in the U.S.      military.       On June 2, 1995, Hayden walked into the U.S. Embassy in      Belgrade to learn that an American F-16 piloted by Air Force      Capt. Scott O'Grady had been shot down over Bosnia. The news      marked a turning point in Hayden's thinking as a soldier.       Serb Gen. Rathko Mladic had been saying publicly that he      would deny Serb airspace to NATO. Operations officers at the      European Command had dismissed the threat, but Hayden was      familiar with Mladic and did not see him making idle threats.      As an intelligence officer, he had informed the operational      commanders of Mladic's statements and relayed his impression      that the general was      not to be trifled with. But he didn't believe it was his      place to voice further objections--until after O'Grady was      shot down.       ``Maybe I [should] have picked up the phone and told the      air commander, `Every time I see that orbit on your morning      slides, I get nervous,' '' Hayden says, ``But I didn't.''       The incident forced Hayden to see the obsolescence of the      military's traditional hierarchy, in which intelligence was      seen merely as a support function. Increasingly, Hayden      realized, intelligence was becoming so essential to make use      of and counter sophisticated weaponry that it had become as      much of a weapon in its own right as any bomb or missile.      ``It was a kind of redefinition of self, as a professional,''      he says. ``It's not about intelligence successes or failures;      it's just successes or failures.''       Hayden's next assignment, as commander of the Air      Intelligence Agency at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio,      gave him plenty of opportunity to further hone his thinking.      Kelly is where the Air Force works on its plans for      cyberwar--attacks designed to take down adversaries'      computer networks. Hayden next served as deputy chief of      staff for the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces      Korea. To those inculcated in military culture, this move      sent a message. He crossed the divide between the bookish      world of intelligence into the front-line world of      operations. In the words of one senior intelligence      official, ``Here you've got an intel weenie who the four-     star operator recognized as something special.''       Late in 1998, he was leading a military delegation      negotiating with a group of North Korean generals at      Panmunjon, where talks at that high a level had not taken      place in seven years. He was in Seoul when Tenet, searching      for a new NSA director, summoned him for an interview. They      met at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where      Tenet was attending Arab-Israeli peace talks hosted by the      Clinton administration. After a relaxed interview in which      Tenet asked Hayden about his views on life and change, Hayden      flew back to Korea with a clear signal from Tenet that the      NSA job was his. Given the job's normal three-year term and      his lack of SIGINT expertise, Hayden knew he'd been handed      the most challenging assignment of his career. Still, he      returned to Seoul in a celebratory mood. He took his wife to      the movie theater at Yongsan Army Garrison, which was playing      a new movie starring Will Smith, ``Enemy of the State.''       The film opens with a scene in which a rogue NSA official      (played by Jon Voigt) assassinates an influential congressman      (Jason Robards) who refuses to back a bill expanding the      agency's power to spy on Americans. From there, the movie      portrays the NSA as a lawless band of high-tech assassins who      try their best to kill a Washington lawyer (Smith) who just      happens to witness another NSA assassination on streets      around Dupont Circle.       As Hayden watched, surrounded by GIs whooping it up in the      theater, he sank lower and lower in his chair.       In real life, the NSA's image problems were a bit more      complicated.       In 1997, the European Parliament had commissioned a report      on Echelon, a global communications system. That report had      concluded that the NSA was capable of intercepting every fax,      phone call and e-mail in Europe. The conclusion was wrong--     Echelon is actually a relatively small system through which      the NSA and its electronic spy partners in the United      Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand divide      responsibility for processing intercepted satellite      communications--but it did not matter. The European      Parliament's anxieties flared into a controversy that      wouldn't go away, fueled by the lawmakers' suspicions that      the NSA was stealing European companies' secrets and passing      them on to their American competitors, a practice NSA      officials say they do not engage in.       Beyond industrial espionage, the Europeans also worried      about individual privacy, because the U.S. laws and      regulations that keep the NSA from spying on Americans      provide no similar protections for foreigners. By 1999, this      controversy had attracted the attention of civil libertarians      in the United States who were concerned about possible NSA      spying against Americans on the Internet, which the agency is      prohibited by law from doing.       While all this was brewing, the agency's boosters on      Capitol Hill were becoming alarmed that the NSA was in      serious trouble because of new communications technologies--     fiber-optic cables that couldn't be tapped, encryption      software that couldn't be broken and cell phone traffic too      voluminous to be processed.       Hayden was keenly aware of the irony: He was inheriting an      agency that was simultaneously being accused of omnipotence      and incompetence. And then, almost as soon as he arrived at      Fort Meade, Hayden discovered another wrinkle: The NSA      director didn't really run the agency. The agency, Hayden      soon come to understand, had been diffused into five      directorates that ran as fiefdoms unto themselves. The      bureaucratic overlap was staggering, and no one had a picture      of the whole. There were 68 different e-mail systems at Fort      Meade, and 452 internal review boards of one sort or another.       It wasn't as though the bureaucracy was actively trying to      sabotage him--``that would have required them to unify,''      Hayden says. Rather, he couldn't get the senior leadership to      agree on anything, ``from whether or not we should invest $2      billion in a new collection system to whether we should serve      grilled cheese'' to visiting delegations.       Early in his tenure, Hayden began plotting an internal      coup, naming two review teams--one made up of NSA insiders,      the other private-sector experts--to tell him what was wrong      with the agency. The results were startling.       The insiders' report blasted Hayden's predecessors and the      NSA's senior civilian managers, saying the agency ``has been      in a leadership crisis for the better part of a decade . . .      the legacy of exceptional service to the nation that is NSA      is in great peril. We have run out of time.''       The outsiders cited the agency's ``reluctance'' to move      from ``legacy targets to newer targets'' and said that NSA      had already become ``deaf'' to concerns from its customers--     military commanders, White House policymakers and the CIA.      ``Right now, when stakeholders tell NSA that `NSA doesn't get      it,' the agency simply repeats itself and talks louder,''      their report said.       But Hayden remained cautious, painfully aware that he was      no expert in signals intelligence. He thought he saw what      needed to be done but didn't feel sure, especially when many      of his senior managers who were SIGINT experts were reluctant      to move.       Then the computers crashed in January 2000, confirming his      worst fears about the agency's antiquated technology and its      leaden bureaucracy.       With the snow outside headquarters still being cleared,      Hayden strode off the stage in Friedman Auditorium. His      challenge--This does not leave the building--was still      ringing in everyone's ears. In a room off the agency's      operations center, he called all of the agency's top      technicians and engineers together and told them just how      serious the meltdown had become. Tenet was still giving      them plenty of room to fashion a solution, Hayden said,      but pressure was building ``downtown.''       Hayden has no trouble remembering the day's event. That      Thursday happened to be his 32nd wedding anniversary. That      night, with the system showing some signs of life, he took      Jeannie to an inn west of Frederick called Stone Manor for      dinner. On the drive home, Robert Stevens, the NSA's deputy      director for technology, called to say that he needed to talk      to Hayden ``secure.'' Hayden called him back on a secure line      as soon as he got home.       The system had been dysfunctional for more than 72 hours.      It was back up to about 25 percent capacity, Stevens said,      but he didn't think the techies were on the right path. He      wanted permission to take the entire system down and start      all over again.       By then, a team of NSA engineers and contractors had      pinpointed an outdated routing protocol as the cause of the      failure. With the system completely shut down, they began      installing a massive hardware and software upgrade. And by      Friday morning, the system was coming back to life, node by      node. Deeply relieved, Tenet drove over to Fort Meade that      night and personally shook the hands of dozens of disheveled,      unshaven techies, many of whom hadn't been home since Monday.       Hayden, feeling much better about life the following      afternoon, went cross-country skiiing with his wife on the      Fort Meade gold course. Soon, he noticed that he was being      shadowed by an NSA patrol car. Trudging through the snow, an      officer asked Hayden to take off his skis and come with him      back to the operations center. George Tenet needed to talk to      him--ABC News had the story.       Tenet told Hayden to talk to the reporter, John McWethy, on      the record so he would get the story right. Hayden said fine.      He knew McWethy, and knew where he was based--the Pentagon.      The leak had come from there, not Fort Meade. ``You held the      line,'' Hayden later told his own people. ``You kept it      secret while it had to be secret.''       But with Hayden's relief came a realization about the      larger task ahead: The price he would pay for moving too      cautiously would greatly exceed whatever he would pay for      being too bold.       He would be bold.       Hayden's internal coup began with an innocuous act: He      hired a chief financial officer. Without one, he had no way      of making strategic decisions based on how much money was      being spent across the entire agency on line items like      research and development, information technology and      security. So Hayden hired Beverly L. Wright, a Wellesley      College graduate with an MBA from the Harvard Business School      and a solid reputation as CFO at the old Baltimore investment      bank of Alex. Brown.       For an agency that had always promoted its own and promised      lifetime employment, hiring from the outside was a radical      act.       Then Hayden did it again, hiring a former GTE      telecommunications executive named Harold C. Smith to take      control of the agency's information technology. In doing so,      he wanted to extend a powerful metaphor he'd drawn from his      experience in the Air Force. He had come to see the service      as the military expression of the American aviation industry      and American culture--its dynamism, its risk taking, its      proud individualism. He believed that the NSA had to become      the intelligence expression of American technology and      American culture. It needed to embrace the innovative,      flexible, entrepreneurial spirit that had come to define the      digital age. ``We can no longer provide to America what we      need to do so isolated from America,'' he says. ``To end the      isolation, America needs to know us better.''        And so, as his housecleaning began, Hayden also launched an      openness campaign, appearing in April 2000 at a rare public      session of the House Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence. With the European Parliament continuing its      Echelon investigation and the American Civil Liberties Union      voicing similar concerns, Hayden told the committee that NSA      employees took great care ``to make sure that we are always      on the correct side of the Fourth Amendment.''       ``Let me put a fine point on this,'' Hayden testified.      ``If, as we are speaking here this afternoon, Osama bin Laden      is walking across the bridge from Niagara Falls, Ontario, to      Niagra Falls, New York, as he gets to the New York side, he      is an American person. And my agency must respect his rights      against unreasonable search and seizure.''       Rep. Heather Wilson (R-N.M.) pressed Hayden on this point.      ``Does NSA spy on the lawful activities of Americans?'' she      asked.       ``No. The answer is we do not,'' Hayden said.       ``Do you inadvertently collect information on U.S.      citizens?'' asked Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.).       Yes, Hayden replied. But, he said, ``if it is not necessary      to understand the foreign intelligence value of the      information collected, it is not reported, it is destroyed.      And it is destroyed as quickly as we can do that.''       Back at Fort Meade, Hayden's grand plan for rebuilding the      agency for the digital age was slowed by his inability to      pick a deputy. He had departed from tradition again,      appointing a search committee instead of simply anointing one      of the bureaucracy's nominees. He was intrigued by the notion      of picking an outsider, even though retired Adm. Bobby Ray      Inman, a legendary past NSA director whom Hayden frequently      called for advice, strongly objected. ``What I thought he      couldn't do was go to somebody who didn't know the      business,'' Inman recalls. ``The learning curve is too long,      and you'd get waited out.''       Ultimately, Hayden resolved the conflict by picking an      insider who had worked as an outsider. William B. Black had      spent 38 years running some of the agency's spookiest      operations before retiring in 1997 and going to work for      Science Applications International Corp. He was, by      training, yet another Russian linguist. But Black had      served a tour as chief of an elite unit focused on Russian      communications. More important, he had run the Special      Collection Service, the joint NSA-CIA operation that works      out of foreign embassies and fuss the talents of human      spies and ultra-tech eavesdroppers to get very close to      particularly difficult targets. Most telling was Black's      final NSA assignment: special assistance to the director      for information warfare. In that role, he had established      the government's preeminent cyberwarfare unit--and      alienated so many NSA bureaucrats by poaching on their      cherished turf that resignation was his only viable      option.       Hayden liked Black's expertise and his reputation as an      iconoclast. In July 2000, he invited Black to his house for      dinner. Over couscous and roasted vegetables the director had      prepared himself, Hayden made it clear that he wanted a      deputy who could help change the system, not end-run it.      Black's one-word answer--``Exactly''--convinced Hayden that      he had his deputy.       With Black onboard, Hayden was ready to move. Last October,      he rolled out his reorganization plan, wresting control of      the agency from its own bureaucracy. All the NSA's support      services would be centralized under Hayden's chief of staff.      And where there were five overlapping directorates, Hayden      would have just two: one for information security (the      agency's codemakers) and another for signals intelligence      (its codebreakers).       Now, he hoped, senior managers could focus on going after      bytes.       A decade ago, a single NSA collection system could field a      million inputs per half-hour. Automated filtering systems      would winnow that to 10 messages that needed review by      analysts. With today's explosion in communications traffic,      multiply a million inputs per half-hour by a 1,000 or 10,000,      and 10 messages needing review becomes 10,000 or 100,000.      Cutting-edge fiber-optic systems now move data at 2.5 to 20      gigabits per second. The latest Intelsat satellites can      process the equivalent of 90,000 simultaneous telephone      calls. A single OC3 line on the Internet transmits 155      million bits per second--the equivalent of 18,000 books a      minute.       From an operational standpoint, the NSA's Cold War vacuum-     cleaner approach is no longer tenable--there's just too much      to be collected, and it's too hard to process. The only way      for the NSA to remain relevant in this environment is to      target the individuals and organizations whose communications      are most valuable--and targeting now is more complicated than      programming a target's telephone number into a computer. To      succeed in the digital age, NSA analysts must understand how      a target communicates, what its Internet protocol addresses      are, and how its traffic is routed around the world.       And with so many conceivable targets in the world, the only      way to zero in on the most important ones is to ask White      House officials, Pentagon commanders and CIA officers to      identify the targets they're interested in. The days when NSA      officials sent the White House whatever interested them are      over.       Now, SIGINT requires the agility to move from system to      system and adapt to new technologies. If that can be done,      the potential for electronic spying is enormous.      Sophisticated Internet surveillance techniques now make it      possible to acquire data ``in motion'' across the network--     and data ``at rest'' in computer databases, the new frontier.       ``The world has never been more wired together than it is      today,'' says Stewart Baker, who served as the NSA's general      counsel from 1992 to 1994. ``It's the golden age of      espionage. Stealing secrets is going to get even easier for      people who employ technologically advanced tools and are      willing to work aggressively at it.''       Even so, the challenges are formidable. The NSA is known to      be hard at work trying to gain access to fiber-optic cables.      How it is doing is not publicly known. One means would be      tapping undersea cables or placing interception pods over      ``repeaters'' that periodically boost fiber-optic signals.      But even if the lines can be tapped, transmitting the torrent      of intercepted data from the depths of the ocean to Fort      Meade in anything close to real time would be far harder      still, possibly requiring the NSA to lay its own fiber-optic      lines from the tap to some sort of relay station.       The most recent European Parliament report on Echelon      concluded that such links would be far too costly. The report      also said that new laser regenerators used to amplify fiber-     optic signals cannot be tapped the way repeaters can, meaning      that ``the use of submarines for the routine surveillance of      international telephone traffic can be ruled out.''       The Navy's decision to spend $1 billion to retrofit its      premier spy submarine, the USS Jimmy Carter, would suggest      American policymakers believe otherwise.       Another challenge facing Hayden's NSA is to decode      communications encrypted with powerful--and widely      available--software. When Hayden became director, the deputy      he inherited told Congress that the encryption software would      make the job of decoding encrypted messages ``difficult, if      not impossible,'' even with the world's largest collection of      supercomputers.       One alternative is to steal 1s and 0s before they are      encrypted, or after they are decrypted. This requires classic      esponage--as practiced by the Special Collection Service, the      top-secret joint CIA-NSA operation. In the Code War, American      spies recruited Soviet code clerks. Now the targets of      choice--the people paid to sell out their governments or      organizations--are systems administrators and other techies      capable of providing encryption keys or planting electronic      ``trapdoors'' in computer systems that can be accessed from      computers on the other side of the world.       The irony amid all this new technology is that human      beings--old fashioned spies--are suddenly as important as      ever.       With his organization laid out and his mission clarified,      Hayden began updating his human resources last December. He      freed up enough slots and cajoled additional funds from      Congress to hire 600 people this year--three times what the      agency had been hiring annually. Sixty senior managers      accepted early retirement incentives, giving him enough      headroom to reach down a generation in selecting new      managers. Maureen A. Baginski, a member of the insiders team      that produced the scathing management assessment for Hayden      back in 1999, headed the class.       She would run the newly created directorate of signals      intelligence. Now, an operations officer targeting a      terrorist cell could team with an engineer who could help him      figure out how the cell's communications were routed around      the world. And though Baginski, too, is a former Russian      linguist, she clearly understood the challenges ahead. ``You      could literally stare for 25 years at the Soviet land mass      and never have this kind of volume problem,'' she says.      ``They were slow, so it was okay if we were slow. Today, it's      volume, it's velocity and it's variety.''       Her management style, too, is more current--more attuned to      the idea of empowering the people beneath her. When a U.S.      Navy EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft--an NSA asset--crash-landed      on China's Hainan Island this spring after colliding with a      Chinese fighter jet, an operations officer called Baginski at      home late on a Saturday night, told her what had happened and      said, ``You will want to come in.''       Baginski replied: ``No, I will not want to come in.'' Her      reasoning was that the agency already had a person charged      with running an emergency response operation. ``Why should I      do it in a crisis if someone else does it every day?''      Baginski said.       As Baginski was settling in, Hayden was busy looking      outside the NSA for new people to work for her--and soon      found the agency swamped. In February, the home of No Such      Agency and Never Say Anything held a job fair to recruit      computer scientists, mathematicians, linguists and analyst to      become new spooks. Seventeen hundred people registered in      advance--and hundreds of walk-ins dressed in dark business      attire showed up and waited in a line that snaked through the      parking lot. Hayden's openness initiative was paying      dividends.       Soon, he advertised in the outside world to fill eight      other top jobs, including chief information officer, chief of      legislative affairs, deputy associate director for research      and chief of SIGINT systems engineering. All of the jobs paid      between $109,000 and $125,000, well below salaries for      commensurate jobs in the private sector. But, as Black is      fond of saying, ``patriotism still works on occasion.''       By the end of March, the NSA began its first major push to      involve the private sector in development of new SIGINT      technology      with an initiative it called Trailblazer. A total of three      contracts, worth about $10 million apiece, were awarded to      corporate consortia led by Booz Allen  Hamilton Inc.,      Lockheed Martin Corp. and TRW's systems and information      technology group.       Skeptics wonder whether it will all be enough, given the      speed with which technology is moving. They also question      whether there is enough top technical talent still left at      the NSA to manage complex relationships with contractors so      that the contracts result in real gains instead of white      elephants. The Federal Aviation Administration, after all,      hired IBM in the late 1980s to design a new air traffic      control system--and ended up abandoning the project at a cost      of $500 million.       But analysts on Capitol Hill and other close observers in      the private sector say Hayden, Black, Baginski and company      appear to be getting their message across that the NSA must      take risks if it is ever to ``own the virtual,'' as one      industry analyst put it.       James Adams, a British journalist turned Internet security      executive who serves on a panel of outside advisers created      by Hayden, says the agency's workforce breaks down into three      distinct camps: 25 percent are enthusiastic about Hayden's      program, 25 percent are threatened and dead set against it,      and 50 percent are sitting on the fence waiting to see who      wins.       Sometime this summer, Hayden plans to publish reduction-in-     force procedures to deal with the naysayers, if need be. He      will keep offering retirement incentives, preferring the      carrot to the stick, but now accepts that layoffs may be      necessary.       They would be the first in the agency's history.       With all the changes, Hayden may be making enemies among      his agency's old guard, but he's also building a powerful      constituency elsewhere. ``We went deaf for 72 hours because      of an antiquated system that should have been upgraded years      ago,'' says Tim Sample, staff director of the House Permanent      Select Committee on Intelligence. ``When you're at that point      in an organization, it takes a monumental effort over a      sustained period to get back up to speed. They needed a      leader--and that's what they got.''       Sample's boss, Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), the      committee's chairman, recently floated the idea of promoting      Hayden to a four-star general and extending his three-year      tour, now less than a year from completion.       Tenet has gone even further. ``My personal view is, Mike      Hayden must stay out there for five years--he has got to have      time on target,'' Tenet says. ``He's thinking out of the box.      He's engaged. He's not afraid of opening up the NSA. He's not      afraid of the American public. And he knows what has to be      done.''       Hayden is willing to stay on, if that's what Tenet and      Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld desire. There is, he knows,      much work still to be done. His personal focus this summer--     now that the computers seem to be working again--is people.      Specifically, promotions. Six months ago, Hayden got rid of      all regulations requiring employees to spend two years at one      pay grade before they get promoted to the next. Now he's      trying to make sure that the agency's hidebound promotions      panels start taking advantage of that freedom. If the right      people don't advance, Hayden believes, nothing else really      matters.       He says he feels more and more confident about the course      he's charted. But there's a certain fatigue in his voice. ``I      feel tired,'' Hayden allows. ``But I see points of light more      frequently.''",

Such corrective action shall      include reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable      costs incurred, and may include back pay and related      benefits, travel expenses, and compensatory damages not to      exceed $300,000.       ``(C) Contributing factor.--In determining whether the      adverse security clearance or access determination violated      paragraph (1) of this subsection, the agency shall find that      paragraph (1) of this subsection was violated if a disclosure      described in paragraph (1) was a contributing factor in the      adverse security clearance or access determination taken      against the individual, unless the agency demonstrates by a      preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the      same action in the absence of such disclosure, giving the      utmost deference to the agency's assessment of the particular      threat to the national security interests of the United      States in the instant matter.       ``(5) Appellate review of security clearance access      determinations by director of national intelligence.--       ``(A) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term `Board'      means the appellate review board established under section      204 of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2011.       ``(B) Appeal.--Within 60 days after receiving notice of an      adverse final agency determination under a proceeding under      paragraph (4), an employee or former employee may appeal that      determination to the Board.       ``(C) Policies and procedures.--The Board, in consultation      with the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence,      and the Secretary of Defense, shall develop and implement      policies and procedures for adjudicating the appeals      authorized by subparagraph (B). The Director of National      Intelligence and Secretary of Defense shall jointly approve      any rules, regulations, or guidance issued by the Board      concerning the procedures for the use or handling of      classified information.       ``(D) Review.--The Board's review shall be on the complete      agency record, which shall be made available to the Board.      The Board may not hear witnesses or admit additional      evidence. Any portions of the record that were submitted ex      parte during the agency proceedings shall be submitted ex      parte to the Board.       ``(E) Further fact-finding or improper denial.--If the      Board concludes that further fact-finding is necessary or      finds that the agency improperly denied the employee or      former employee the opportunity to present evidence that, if      admitted, would have a substantial likelihood of altering the      outcome, the Board shall remand the matter to the agency from      which it originated for additional proceedings in accordance      with the rules of procedure issued by the Board.       ``(F) De novo determination.--The Board shall make a de      novo determination, based on the entire record and under the      standards specified in paragraph (4), of whether the employee      or former employee received an adverse security clearance or      access determination in violation of paragraph (1). In      considering the record, the Board may weigh the evidence,      judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine      controverted questions of fact. In doing so, the Board may      consider the prior fact-finder's opportunity to see and hear      the witnesses.       ``(G) Adverse security clearance or access determination.--     If the Board finds that the adverse security clearance or      access determination violated paragraph (1), it shall then      separately determine whether reinstating the security      clearance or access determination is clearly consistent with      the interests of national security, with any doubt resolved      in favor of national security, under Executive Order 12968      (60 Fed. Reg. 40245; relating to access to classified      information) or any successor thereto (including any      adjudicative guidelines promulgated under such orders) or any      subsequent Executive order, regulation, or policy concerning      access to classified information.       ``(H) Remedies.--       ``(i) Corrective action.--If the Board finds that the      adverse security clearance or access determination violated      paragraph (1), it shall order the agency head to take      specific corrective action to return the employee or former      employee, as nearly as practicable and reasonable, to the      position such employee or former employee would have held had      the violation not occurred. Such corrective action shall      include reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable      costs incurred, and may include back pay and related      benefits, travel expenses, and compensatory damages not to      exceed $300,000. The Board may recommend, but may not order,      reinstatement or hiring of a former employee. The Board may      order that the former employee be treated as though the      employee were transferring from the most recent position held      when seeking other positions within the executive branch. Any      corrective action shall not include the reinstating of any      security clearance or access determination. The agency head      shall take the actions so ordered within 90 days, unless the      Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Energy,      or the Secretary of Defense, in the case of any component of      the Department of Defense, determines that doing so would      endanger national security.       ``(ii) Recommended action.--If the Board finds that      reinstating the employee or former employee's security      clearance or access determination is clearly consistent with      the interests of national security, it shall recommend such      action to the head of the entity selected under subsection      (b) and the head of the affected agency.       ``(I) Congressional notification.--       ``(i) Orders.--Consistent with the protection of sources      and methods, at the time the Board issues an order, the      Chairperson of the Board shall notify--       ``(I) the Committee on Homeland Security and Government      Affairs of the Senate;       ``(II) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate;       ``(III) the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of      the House of Representatives;       ``(IV) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of      the House of Representatives; and       ``(V) the committees of the Senate and the House of      Representatives that have jurisdiction over the employing      agency, including in the case of a final order or decision of      the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-     Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, or the      National Reconnaissance Office, the Committee on Armed      Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of      the House of Representatives.       ``(ii) Recommendations.--If the agency head and the head of      the entity selected under subsection (b) do not follow the      Board's recommendation to reinstate a clearance, the head of      the entity selected under subsection (b) shall notify the      committees described in subclauses (I) through (V) of clause      (i).       ``(6) Judicial review.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed to permit or require judicial review of any--       ``(A) agency action under this section; or       ``(B) action of the appellate review board established      under section 204 of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement      Act of 2011.       ``(7) Private cause of action.--Nothing in this section      shall be construed to permit, authorize, or require a private      cause of action to challenge the merits of a security      clearance determination.''.       (c) Access Determination Defined.--Section 3001(a) of the      Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (50      U.S.C. 435b(a)) is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(9) The term `access determination' means the process for      determining whether an employee--       ``(A) is eligible for access to classified information in      accordance with Executive Order 12968 (60 Fed.

Reg.      1583; relating to safeguarding classified information with      industry); and       ``(B) possesses a need to know under that Order.''.        (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in section 3001 of the      Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (50      U.S.C. 435b), as amended by this Act, shall be construed to      require the repeal or replacement of agency appeal procedures      implementing Executive Order 12968 (60 Fed. Reg. 40245;      relating to classified national security information), or any      successor thereto, and Executive Order 10865 (25 Fed.

The assessment shall be conducted by an      independent, non-governmental institute which is described in      section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and      exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code, and has      recognized credentials and expertise in national security      science and engineering laboratories and with ready access to      policy experts throughout the United States.       (2) Background material.--The assessment shall leverage      previous studies, including--       (A) the report published in 2009 by the Stimson Center      titled ``Leveraging Science for Security: A Strategy for the      Nuclear Weapons Laboratories in the 21st Century''; and       (B) the Phase 1 report published in 2012 by the National      Academy of Sciences titled ``Managing for High-Quality      Science and Engineering at the NNSA National Security      laboratories''.

(B) A recommendation as to which, if any, other      laboratories associated with any national security agency      should be included in the new governance structure.       (C) Options for implementing the new governance structure      that minimize disruption of performance and costs to the      government while rapidly achieving anticipated gains.       (D) Legislative changes and executive actions that would      need to be made in order to implement the new governance      structure.       (b) Report.--       (1) In general.--Not later than January 1, 2014, the      designated private entity shall submit to the Administrator      and the congressional defense committees a report that      contains the findings of the assessment.       (2) Form.--The report under paragraph (1) shall be      submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified      annex.       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``national      security laboratory'' has the meaning given that term in      section 3281 of the National Nuclear Security Administration      Act (50 U.S.C. 2471).",

Along with a distinguished military career, his service as Chief of the National Security Agency for I believe 6 years during the Clinton administration is a testimony to his nonpartisan service. One noteworthy incident alone provides us with persuasive evidence of Admiral McConnell's independent judgement. Now, regardless of how one interprets the most recent National Intelligence Estimate concerning Iran, the one that was so controversial, any attempt to attack Admiral McConnell as a ``tool'' of the Bush administration would appear to lack all credibility.

        "statement": "The USA Freedom Act will protect our security and privacy.       A recent Baltimore Sun editorial described legislation to      reform the government's collection of Americans' phone and      email data as a sign that ``bipartisan cooperation in      Congress is not completely dead'' (``Reining in the      surveillance state,'' May 5). We'd like to remind The Sun      that similar legislation to end the mass storage of this data      passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan majority--it      garnered more than 300 votes, in fact--over a year ago.       In our role as leaders on the House Intelligence Committee,      we drafted and introduced last year's bill together with our      colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Reps. Bob Goodlatte      and John Conyers. Our success provided the foundation for the      legislation that passed the House by an even larger margin on      Wednesday. The USA Freedom Act ends the bulk collection of      what we now know as ``metadata''--that big database up at the      National Security Agency that contains the phone numbers of      millions of Americans will go away. The government will now      have to seek court approval before petitioning private cell      phone companies for records. The court will have to approve      each application, except in emergencies, and major court      decisions will be made public.       We need this reform to keep our country safe. Section 215      of the Patriot Act, which is the part that legalizes much of      NSA's critical work to protect us from terrorists, expires in      less than three weeks on June 1. If we do not reauthorize it      with the reforms demanded by the public, essential      capabilities to track legitimate terror suspects will expire,      too.       That couldn't happen at a worse time--we live in a      dangerous world. The threats posed by ISIS and other terror      groups are just the tip of the iceberg. We also need strong      defenses against increasingly aggressive cyber terrorists and      the ``lone wolf'' terrorists who are often American citizens,      for example.       This bill restores Americans' confidence that the      government is not snooping on its own citizens by improving      the necessary checks and balances essential to our Democracy.      We helped write it last year, we support it this year and we      hope Republicans and Democrats continue working together on      common sense reforms to protect our national security and our      civil liberties.",

        "statement": "One by one, several powerful Republican senators took to      the floor Thursday morning to offer one of the most full-     throated defenses of the National Security Agency's bulk      collection of billions of U.S. phone records since Edward      Snowden exposed the program nearly two years ago.       The crux of their argument is unmistakable: The NSA's      expansive surveillance powers need to remain intact and      unchanged to keep Americans safe from potential terrorist      threats--and if these powers existed before Sept. 11, 2001,      they may have assisted in preventing the attacks on the World      Trade Center and the Pentagon.       But some of the talking points used by Senate Majority      Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies appear to rely heavily      on assertions that are either dubious in their veracity or      elide important contextual details.       Here is a review of some of their declarations:       Claim: ``Not only have these tools kept us safe, there has      not been a single incident, not one, of intentional abuse of      them.''--McConnell       McConnell may have been referring specifically to the phone      records program here, but the NSA does not, as he implies,      have a spotless record.       According to a 2013 inspector general report, NSA analysts      intentionally misused foreign surveillance authorities at      least a dozen times in the past decade, sometimes for the      purpose of spying on their romantic interests. So-called      ``loveint''--short for ``love intelligence''--was revealed by      the inspector general in response to a letter sent from      Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who this year renewed a call      for the Justice Department to provide an update on how it was      handling its investigation into the alleged willful abuses      and to ``appropriate accountability for those few who violate      the trust placed in them.''       Additionally, a 2012 internal audit obtained by The      Washington Post found that the NSA has violated privacy      restrictions set in place for its surveillance programs      thousands of times each year since 2008. The audit found that      most--though not all--infractions were unintended.       Claim: ``The compromise legislation rolls us back to the      same thing we were doing pre-9/11.''--Senate Intelligence      Chairman Richard Burr       The USA Freedom Act referenced by Burr would reauthorize      three key surveillance provisions under the post-9/11 Patriot      Act. It would usher in several reforms related to      transparency and oversight, but it would keep those      authorities intact. Section 215 of the law would no longer      allow for the bulk collection of U.S. phone metadata by the      NSA, but the authority--created after 9/11--would still      exist.       Claim: ``The alternatives to the current program would not      come close to offering the capabilities that now enable us to      protect Americans.''--Sen. Tom Cotton       Cotton's claim does not align with the stance of Director      of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-Attorney      General Eric Holder, who sent a letter to lawmakers last year      expressing their support for an earlier iteration of the      Freedom Act. ``The intelligence community believes that your      bill preserves essential intelligence-community capabilities;      and the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director      of National Intelligence support your bill and believe that      it is a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil      liberties and increases transparency,'' the letter read. That      version of the Freedom Act is widely considered more limiting      of surveillance powers than the one being debated in Congress      this year.       Claim: ``One alternative offered by opponents of this      program is to have phone companies retain control of all call      data and provide the NSA only the data responsive to searches      phone companies would run on the NSA's behalf. This is not      technologically feasible.''--Cotton       The reliance on phone companies to retain call data already      occurs, as they are the ones who turn the records over to the      government in bulk. Cotton, who voted for a pared down      iteration of the Freedom Act last year when he served in the      House, cites an 85-page study from the National Research      Council to support this assertion. But the Arkansas freshman      appears to be conflating its findings, which dealt with      whether software could fully replace bulk collection, with      what backers of the Freedom Act are attempting to do.      ``Although no software can fully replace bulk with targeted      information collection, software can be developed to more      effectively target collection and to control the usage of      collected data,'' the report concluded. Cotton's      reservations--that the new system may take longer than the      old--have more to do with process than technological      capabilities.       Claim: ``Here's the truth. If this program had existed      before 9/11, it is quite possible that we would have known      that the 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar was living in San      Diego and making phone calls to an al-Qaida safehouse in      Yemen. There's no guarantee we would have known. Theres no      way we can go back in time and prove it, but there is a      probability that we would have known and there's a      probability that American lives could have been saved.''--     Sen. Marco Rubio.       Rubio hedges his language several times with this claim,      but the statement still omits important context. As reported      by a 2013 ProPublica investigation, ``U.S. intelligence      agencies knew the identity of the hijacker in question, Saudi      national Khalid al-Mihdhar, long before 9/11 and had the      ability find him, but they failed to do so.'' Such missed      opportunities to disrupt Midhar's activities, which were      being monitored by at least as early as 1999, reflect a      failure of information sharing among intelligence agencies,      ProPublica notes, and are described in detail in the 9/11      Commission report.",

It is unfortunate that those actions will continue to make it more difficult to gather the information necessary to counter terrorism. It is even more alarming that this trend will inevitably make our country less safe.   Very few Americans will ever learn the full details of the considerable successes of the National Security Agency (NSA). But through the dedication and commitment of its men and women, the NSA has helped to keep our nation and its citizens safe. I remain confident in their professionalism as they strive to prevent future terrorist attacks and support our warfighters overseas.   I believe the first job of the federal government is to defend the country and protect our citizens within the framework of the Constitution, and I will continue to do all I can to contribute to that effort.",

        "statement": "Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has      made it clear to his colleagues that he wants the USA Patriot      Act, including the controversial parts of the legislation      scheduled to expire at the end of June, fully extended. He's      seems ready to do whatever he can to get his way.       The USA Patriot Act was enacted in the days following Sept.      11, when the nation trembled on the verge of panic, with      little debate and little opposition in Congress. The Patriot      Act has been recognized since on both left and right as      unfortunate legislation that granted too much power to the      government to snoop into the lives, calls and emails of      everyone in the name of national security.       Mr. McConnell thought he could force the Senate to either      let the law lapse, to panic everyone again, or get an      extension without modification until the year 2020. Even as      Mr. McConnell praised the National Security Agency's reliance      on the act to justify the collection of telephonic      ``metadata'' from millions of Americans, the 2nd U.S. Circuit      Court of Appeals was writing the decision, released Thursday,      declaring the government program, first revealed by Edward      Snowden, illegal because the language of the act cannot be      read to justify such sweeping government action.       The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties      Union and joined by groups,      including the National Rifle Association, and welcomed by      civil libertarians across the land. To continue the program,      the Obama administration would presumably have to persuade      Congress to adopt language specifically authorizing the NSA      to collect and hold such data. That attempt might be      forthcoming.       The court's decision gives a boost to the advocates for the      USA Freedom Act, which would modify the Patriot Act. The      Freedom Act is expected to pass in the House and Mr.      McConnell's strategy to kill it in the Senate may not work      now, given the appeals court's decision.       Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate      Judiciary Committee, read the 97-page opinion and said,      ``Congress should take up and pass the bipartisan USA Freedom      Act, which would ban bulk collection under Section 215 and      enact other meaningful surveillance reforms.''       The opinion of the liberal senator from Vermont is shared      by the conservative Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, an      author of the Patriot Act who has since regretted its excess.      He joined the ACLU lawsuit as ``a friend of the court,'' and      said Thursday that ``it's time for Congress to pass the USA      Freedom Act in order to protect both civil liberties and      national security with legally authorized surveillance.''       When the chips are down, blind partisanship, with genuine      cooperation, can still be put aside.",

        "statement": "Beyond the firing of CIA officer Mary O. McCarthy for      leaking classified information to the press is a much larger      story of the administration's increasing investigation of      other such press leaks as a possible prelude to an American      version of Britain's stringent Official Secrets Act. In      February, CIA Director Porter Goss told the Senate      Intelligence Committee of the need for a grand jury      investigation including reporters who receive these leaks.       The charge against Miss McCarthy, which she denies, is that      she was a source of highly classified information for Dana      Priest's report in The Washington Post on CIA secret prisons      in Eastern Europe. Miss Priest, a 2006 winner of a Pulitzer      award for the story, has been writing about the CIA's ``black      sites'' since late 2002; and Sen. Pat Roberts, chairman of      the Senate Intelligence Committee, continually refuses to      authorize an investigation of the CIA's violations of      American and international laws in its prisons wholly hidden      from our rule of law.       Miss Priest is already subject to a Justice Department      investigation, as are New York Times reporters James Risen      and Eric Lichtblau for their disclosure of the president's      secret approval of the National Security Agency's warrantless      surveillance of Americans. (Those reporters have also      received Pulitzers this year, despite the president's      characterization of their reporting as ``shameful.'')       The administration's position has been clearly stated by      FBI spokesman Bill Carter (The Washington Post, April 19):      ``Under the law, no private person (including journalists)      may possess classified documents that were illegally provided      to them. These documents remain the property of the      government.''       The law Mr. Carter cited is this administration's expansion      of the Espionage Act of 1917, which is now before the courts      in a case that can greatly diminish the First Amendment      rights of the press--and the right of Americans to receive      information about such lawless government practices as the      CIA's secret interrogation centers and the president's      violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in      unleashing the National Security Agency.       This espionage case--United States of America v. Lawrence      Anthony Franklin, Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman--is the      first in which the federal government is charging violations      of the Espionage Act by American citizens--who are not      government officials--for being involved in what until now      have been regarded as First Amendment-protected activities      engaged in by hundreds of American journalists.       Messrs. Rosen and Weissman, former staff members of the      American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)--who have      since been fired--are accused of receiving classified      information from Defense Department analyst Franklin      regarding U.S. government Middle East and terrorism strategy.      Messrs. Rosen and Weissman are charged with then providing      that classified information to an Israeli diplomat--and a      journalist.       Government official Franklin has pleaded guilty and been      sentenced to prison. But defense attorneys for Rosen and      Weissman declare: ``Never (until now) has a lobbyist,      reporter or any other nongovernment employee been charged . .      . for receiving oral information the government alleges to be      national-defense material as part of that (accused) person's      normal First Amendment-protected activities.''       In an amicus brief to the U.S. District Court for the      Eastern District of Virginia, the Reporters Committee for the      Freedom of the Press (with which I am affiliated) says:       ``These charges potentially eviscerate the primary function      of journalism--to gather and publicize information of public      concern--particularly where the most valuable information to      the public is information that the government wants to      conceal'' so that the public cannot ``participate in and      serve as a check on the government.'' (That's why the First      Amendment's freedom of the press was added to the      Constitution in 1791.)       But the judge now hearing this espionage case, T.S. Ellis      III, already said in March: ``Persons who come into      unauthorized possession of classified information must abide      by the law. That applies to academics, lawyers, journalists,      professors, whatever.'' Recently, the judge appears to be      backing off.       However he decides, and it's uncertain, Steven Aftergood--     head of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation      of American Scientists--says: ``To make a crime of the kind      of conversations Rosen and Weissman had with Franklin over      lunch would not be surprising in the People's Republic of      China. But it's utterly foreign to the American political      system.'' (This censorship of the press was cut out of the      Espionage Act of 1917.)       If the Supreme Court agrees with the Bush administration on      this case, we will, as Mr. Aftergood says, have to build many      more jails--and disarm the First Amendment.",

        "statement": "(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) On June 23, 2009, the Secretary of Defense directed the      Commander of the United States Strategic Command to establish      the United States Cyber Command, which became operational on      May 21, 2010, and operates as a sub-unified command      subordinate to the United States Strategic Command.       (2) In May 2012, media reports indicated that General      Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,      planned to recommend to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta      that the two-year-old United States Cyber Command be elevated      to full combatant command status.       (3) On August 14, 2012, General Keith Alexander, the      Commander of the United States Cyber Command and the Director      of the National Security Agency, addressed the TechNet Land      Forces conference and stated that ``[i]n 2007 we drafted . .      . a paper . . . about establishing a Cyber Command . . .      [which concluded that] . . . the most logical is to set it up      as a sub unified and grow it to a unified, and I think that's      the process that we're going to work our way through''.       (4) On October 11, 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta      discussed cybersecurity in a speech to the Business      Executives for National Security in New York, New York,      specifically calling for a strengthening of the United States      Cyber Command and stating that the Department of Defense      ``must ensure that [the United States Cyber Command] has the      resources, that it has the authorities, that it has the      capabilities required to perform this growing mission. And it      must also be able to react quickly to events unfolding in      cyberspace and help fully integrate cyber into all of the      department's plans and activities.''.       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--       (1) recognizes the serious cyber threat to national      security and the need to work both offensively and      defensively to protect the Nation's networks and critical      infrastructure;       (2) acknowledges the importance of the unified command      structure of the Department in directing military operations      in cyberspace and recognizes that a change in the status of      the United States Cyber Command has Department-wide and      national security implications, which require careful      consideration;       (3) expects to be briefed and consulted about any proposal      to elevate the United States Cyber Command to a unified      command before a decision by the Secretary make such a      proposal to the President and to receive, at a minimum--       (A) a clear statement of mission and related legal      definitions;       (B) an outline of the specific national security benefits      of elevating the sub-unified United States Cyber Command to a      unified command;       (C) an estimate of the cost of creating a unified United      States Cyber Command and a justification of the expenditure;      and       (D) if the Secretary considers it advisable to continue the      designation of the Commander of the United States Cyber      Command as also being the Director of the National Security      Agency--       (i) an explanation of how a single individual could serve      as a commander of a combatant command that conducts overt,      albeit clandestine, cyber operations under title 10, United      States Code, as well as the director of an intelligence      agency that conducts covert cyber operations under the      National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in a      manner that affords deniability to the United States; and       (ii) a statement of whether the Secretary believes it is      appropriate either to appoint a line officer as the Director      of the National Security Agency or to take the unprecedented      step of appointing an intelligence officer as a unified      commander; and       (4) believes that appropriate policy foundations and      standing rules of engagement must be in place before any      decision to create a unified United States Cyber Command.",

        "statement": "``What political power could ever carry on the vast      multitude of lesser undertakings which the American citizens      perform every day, with the assistance of the principle of      association,'' wrote French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville      when he visited the United States to observe American      government. Tocqueville evaluates the American governance and      decides that for democracy to be effective in America,      citizens and organizations must actively participate in the      government. After the American Revolution, representatives      from each state met together to write the Constitution, an      American standard for how democracy would function. Recently,      however, the government has been less productive than in the      past. Some have begun to question if democracy can remain an      effective form of government in the current era. Democracy      has the potential to be a flourishing style of government,      but is predicated on the protection of individuals' rights      and liberties, people's access to education and information,      and actively participating citizens, all of which, they      claim, are resting on shaky grounds.       First and foremost, individual liberties must be guaranteed      to everyone in a democracy. This provides protection to      minority groups whose rights may otherwise be construed upon.      Civil liberties can be encroached upon during times of      national crises. A recent example of this is the Patriot      Act, which was enacted after the terrorist attacks on      September 11, 2001. Even though reining in civil liberties      seemed appropriate for national security reasons in the      immediate aftermath, there have been unintended consequences      whereby our basic civil rights have been infringed. The      debate over the role of the National Security Agency is      currently being adjudicated in federal courts because many      people feel that their fourth amendment rights are being      violated. The expansion and retraction of our rights must      continually be examined, and the government must provide      enforcement of these rights to all citizens to create a bond      of trust between the people and the government.       Secondly, education should be available to all citizens,      policies must be transparent, information should be widely      accessible, and diverse points of views should be encouraged.      When citizens in a democracy are educated, democracy      functions much more effectively. Across countries, education      and democracy are highly correlated. In other words, those      who receive poor education are less likely to be politically      active. Also, less educated people are more vulnerable to      propaganda and false information, leaving them susceptible to      vote based on the influence of others. Citizens also deserve      access to uncensored information. In regimes where      information is tightly controlled, citizens are restricted      from developing their own opinions and this limits their      capacity to fully engage in the political process. It is the      government's responsibility to provide basic education and      ensure freedom of the press so that citizens are engaged and      empowered to play a part in a successful democracy.       Finally, citizens must fulfill their civic duties in a      democracy. These include voting and jury duty but can also be      as simple as staying updated on current issues and obeying      the law. Unfortunately, many of these simple duties are      commonly overlooked. Even in the last presidential election      in 2012, where there was a record voter turnout only about      60% of registered voters voted. Thus, the voice of around 40%      of people was not heard in the ballot. Similarly, fulfilling      civic responsibilities is necessary for democracy to work      well. For example, jury duty has been difficult to implement.      According to Sun Sentinel, in South Florida about two of      every three people skip jury duty with or without being      exempted. Jurors in South Florida have only a 41% response      rate and 3,000 people must be requested to fill 1,000 jury      spots because of the high rejection rate. This may be an      extreme case, but the lack of commitment to civic      responsibility is not unique to Florida. Complacency in civic      involvement ultimately leads to erosion of democracy and make      our system stale and unsustainable.       The ``lesser undertakings which the American citizens      perform every day'' are essential in a democracy because      government cannot fulfill all the needs of citizens. In a      successful democracy individual rights and liberties must be      applied impartially, education and current information must      be readily available, and the citizens must do their part to      allow the law to be applied fairly. America has survived and      struggled through adversities to become one of the longest      living democracies in the world because of its strong      commitment to the Constitution, impartial application of the      law and unrestricted information from varying political      opinions. Democracy is an active and dynamic process, and      flourishes with self-examination and engagement of its      citizens, but languishes with complacency.",

It has been plagued by facility and management problems for many years. The buildings at the center are in deplorable condition and fail to meet health and safety standards. Overcrowding, mismanagement, escapes, drug use and abuse of detainees at the center have been the subject of numerous investigations, press reports and lawsuits over the years, and are of great concern to juvenile justice advocates, families of detainees and local residents, alike. Nearly two decades ago, a consent decree stemming from the lawsuit Jerry M. v. District of Columbia, required the District to make improvements at the facility and address the chronic neglect of its adolescent detainees. Since the decree, ``sixty judicial orders, 44 monitoring reports and almost $3 million in court imposed fines'' have been issued in connection with the District's Youth Services Administration failure to fully comply with the decree, according to a July 2001 article in the Washington Post. Last year a report issued by the District's Inspector General's office found that, ``many of the same types of problems that resulted in the 1986 Jerry M. lawsuit still exist today . . .'' The report documented numerous security problems, health issues, deficiencies in management, failures to effectively maintain the safety of female youth housed at the center, and drugs being smuggled into the facility on a continual basis.",

As a member of the House Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees, I am fully aware of the dangers posed by those who wish to harm Americans, and I have strongly supported efforts to make our Nation safer. However, President Bush has not yet explained to my satisfaction why powers available to him under existing law cannot meet the needs of the war on terrorism. For example, the Foreign Intelligence Service Act (FISA) already permits the warrantless surveillance of communications by U.S. citizens under certain limited circumstances. Nevertheless, the Bush Administration did not use those emergency powers and instead chose to expand the authority of the National Security Agency (NSA).",

        "statement": "Dear Member of Congress, We write to call your attention to      the recent call from five former U.S. secretaries of state      for the U.S. to open talks with Iran. We urge you to speak      out in favor of such talks and to support legislation to      encourage them.       Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, James Baker III, Madeleine      Albright, and Warren Christopher all urged the U.S. to open a      dialogue with Iran to find common ground and resolve      differences on Iraq, Iran's nuclear program, and other      issues.       The administration's policy of avoiding serious      negotiations with Iran until Iran suspends uranium enrichment      has not worked. We agree with those in Congress and elsewhere      who have argued that to offer bilateral negotiations with a      precondition is no offer at all, especially when the      precondition is the object of the negotiations. This position      guarantees that the negotiations with the best chance of      settling U.S.-Iran differences will not begin.       Former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and      the late former National Security Agency director William      Odom wrote recently that ``Current U.S. policy toward the      regime in Tehran will almost certainly result in an Iran with      nuclear weapons.'' They and many other analysts have      concluded) that U.S. military action against Iran would only      delay an Iranian nuclear weapons program and insure their      determination to acquire nuclear weapons. Extreme elements      would be strengthened and the cause of reform in Iran would      be set back for years to come. Military action would also      increase animosity toward the U.S. in the Middle East and      elsewhere. It would prompt a big spike in the price of oil      and would likely lead to retaliatory actions against the U.S.      in Iraq and Afghanistan.        Current U.S. policy not to seriously negotiate with Iran      has failed. The absence of talks and the addition of ever      more stringent economic sanctions will resolve nothing.      Military action would be disastrous. The only sensible option      that serves the interests of the U.S. and the nations of the      Middle East is to explore the possibility of finding common      ground with Iran through direct negotiations. Common ground      is not hard to imagine. For starters, both countries have an      interest in a stable Iraq, a Taliban-free Afghanistan, and      increased oil production capacity in Iran. The U.S. need not      wait to develop leverage.       Please add your voice to those of the five former U.S.      secretaries of state and other senior figures who are urging      the U.S. to open talks with Iran. And please look for      legislative opportunities to put Congress on record in      support of such talks.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                         Jim Fine,     Legislative Secretary for Foreign Policy.",

Nothing has changed, by the way. When      we're talking about chasing down      terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order before      we do so.'' White House Press conference on April 20, 2004.      [White House Transcript]       (B) ``Law enforcement officers need a federal judge's      permission to wiretap a foreign terrorist's phone, or to      track his calls, or to search his property. Officers must      meet strict standards to use any of the tools we're talking      about.'' President Bush's speech in Baltimore Maryland on      July 20th 2005. [White House Transcript]       (2) The President repeatedly ordered the NSA to place      wiretaps on American citizens without requesting a warrant      from FISA as evidenced by the following:       (A) ``Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush      secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop      on Americans and others inside the United States to search      for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved      warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according      to government officials.'' New York Times article by James      Risen and Eric Lichtblau on December 12, 2005. [NYTimes]       (B) The President admits to authorizing the program by      stating ``I have reauthorized this program more than 30 times      since the September the 11th attacks, and I intend to do so      for as long as our nation faces a continuing threat from al      Qaeda and related groups. The NSA's activities under this      authorization are thoroughly reviewed by the Justice      Department and NSA's top legal officials, including NSA's      general counsel and inspector general. Leaders in Congress      have been briefed more than a dozen times on this      authorization and the activities conducted under it.'' Radio      Address from the White House on December 17, 2005. [White      House Transcript]       (C) In a December 19th 2005 press conference the President      publicly admitted to using a combination of surveillance      techniques including some with permission from the FISA      courts and some without permission from FISA.       Reporter: It was, why did you skip the basic safeguards of      asking courts for permission for the intercepts?       The President: . . . We use FISA still--you're referring to      the FISA court in your question--of course, we use FISAs. But      FISA is for long-term monitoring. What is needed in order to      protect the American people is the ability to move quickly to      detect. Now, having suggested this idea, I then, obviously,      went to the question, is it legal to do so? I am--I swore to      uphold the laws. Do I have the legal authority to do this?      And the answer is, absolutely. As I mentioned in my remarks,      the legal authority is derived from the Constitution, as well      as the authorization of force by the United States      Congress.'' [White House Transcript]       (D) Mike McConnel, the Director of National Intelligence,      in a letter to to Senator Arlen Specter, acknowledged that      Bush's Executive Order in 2001 authorized a series of secret      surveillance activities and included undisclosed activities      beyond the warrantless surveillance of e-mails and phone      calls that Bush confirmed in December 2005. ``NSA Spying Part      of Broader Effort'' by Dan Eggen, Washington Post, 8/1/07.       (3) The President ordered the surveillance to be conducted      in a way that would spy upon private communications between      American citizens located within the United States borders as      evidenced by the following:       (A) Mark Klein, a retired AT communications technician,      submitted an affidavit in support of the Electronic Frontier      Foundation's FF's lawsuit against AT He testified that in      2003 he connected a ``splitter'' that sent a copy of Internet      traffic and phone calls to a secure room that was operated by      the NSA in the San Francisco office of AT He heard from a      co-worker that similar rooms were being constructed in other      cities, including Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles and San      Diego. From ``Whistle-Blower Outs NSA Spy Room,'' Wired News,      4/7/06 [Wired] [EFF Case]       (4) The President asserted an inherent authority to conduct      electronic surveillance based on the Constitution and the      ``Authorization to use Military Force in Iraq'' (AUMF) that      was not legally valid as evidenced by the following:       (A) In a December 19th, 2005 Press Briefing General Alberto      Gonzales admitted that the surveillance authorized by the      President was not only done without FISA warrants, but that      the nature of the surveillance was so far removed from what      FISA can approve that FISA could not even be amended to allow      it. Gonzales stated ``We have had discussions with Congress      in the past--certain members of Congress--as to whether or      not FISA could be amended to allow us to adequately deal with      this kind of threat, and we were advised that that would be      difficult, if not impossible.''.       (B) The fourth amendment to the United States Constitution      states ``The right of the people to be secure in their      persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable      searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants      shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or      affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be      searched, and the persons or things to be seized.''       (C) ``The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978      unambiguously limits warrantless domestic electronic      surveillance, even in a congressionally declared war, to the      first 15 days of that war; criminalizes any such electronic      surveillance not authorized by statute; and expressly      establishes FISA and two chapters of the federal criminal      code, governing wiretaps for intelligence purposes and for      criminal investigation, respectively, as the ``exclusive      means by which electronic surveillance . . . and the      interception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic      communications may be conducted.'' 50 U.S.C. 1811, 1809, 18      U.S.C. 2511(2)(f).'' Letter from Harvard Law Professor      Lawrence Tribe to John Conyers on 1/6/06.       (D) In a December 19th, 2005 Press Briefing Attorney      General Alberto Gonzales stated ``Our position is, is that      the authorization to use force, which was passed by the      Congress in the days following September 11th, constitutes      that other authorization, that other statute by Congress, to      engage in this kind of signals intelligence.''       (E) The ``Authorization to use Military Force in Iraq''      does not give any explicit authorization related to      electronic surveillance. [HJRes114]       (F) ``From the foregoing analysis, it appears unlikely that      a court would hold that Congress has expressly or impliedly      authorized the NSA electronic surveillance operations here      under discussion, and it would likewise appear that, to the      extent that those surveillances fall within the definition of      ``electronic surveillance'' within the meaning of FISA or any      activity regulated under Title III, Congress intended to      cover the entire field with these statutes.'' From the      ``Presidential Authority to Conduct Warrantless Electronic      Surveillance to Gather Foreign Intelligence Information'' by      the Congressional Research Service on January 5, 2006.       (G) ``The inescapable conclusion is that the AUMF did not      implicitly authorize what the FISA expressly prohibited. It      follows that the presidential program of surveillance at      issue here is a violation of the separation of powers--as      grave an abuse of executive authority as I can recall ever      having studied.'' Letter from Harvard Law Professor Lawrence      Tribe to John Conyers on 1/6/06.       (H) On August 17, 2006 Judge Anna Diggs Taylor of the      United States District Court in Detroit, in ACLU v. NSA,      ruled that the ``NSA program to wiretap the international      communications of some Americans without a court warrant      violated the Constitution. . . . Judge Taylor ruled that the      program violated both the Fourth Amendment and a 1978 law      that requires warrants from a secret court for intelligence      wiretaps involving people in the United States. She rejected      the administration's repeated assertions that a 2001      Congressional authorization and the president's      constitutional authority allowed the program.'' From a New      York Times article ``Judge Finds Wiretap Actions Violate the      Law'' 8/18/06 and the Memorandum Opinion.       (I) In July 2007, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals      dismissed the case, ruling the plaintiffs had no standing to      sue because, given the secretive nature of the surveillance,      they could not state with certainty that they have been      wiretapped by the NSA. This ruling did not address the      legality of the surveillance so Judge Taylor's decision is      the only ruling on that issue. [ACLU Legal Documents]       In all of these actions and decisions, President George W.      Bush has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President      and Commander in Chief, and subversive of constitutional      government, to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice      and to the manifest injury of the people of the United      States. Wherefore, President George W. Bush, by such conduct,      is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from      office.",
